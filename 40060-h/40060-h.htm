<h2>Introduction</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>


<p>It was my good fortune to hear the lectures contained in this volume
when they were given in the Miller Chapel of Princeton Theological
Seminary. The high estimate I then formed of them has since been
enhanced by the reading of the proof-sheets.</p>

<p>Professor Johnson is a well-trained student of philosophy and for some
years has been professionally engaged in the teaching of New Testament
criticism. He may therefore be trusted as a competent judge of the
issues that are raised by anti-Christian thought in the two great fields
of contemporary controversy.</p>

<p>The only view of Christianity worth contending for in any serious way is
that which regards it as a supernatural revelation. The author states
his own position in the first lecture. This position is antagonized by
those who hold a naturalistic or pantheistic view of the world and also
by those who, whatever may be their philosophy, are using the weapons of
historical criticism to discredit miraculous Christianity.</p>

<p>I can imagine that there are two classes of Christians for whom these
lectures will have only a moderate interest: those who are possessed of
a strong and aggressive faith and who are impatient of all discussion<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
that seems to carry with it the implication that their religious
convictions stand in need of any defense; and those who, by reason of
their easy acquiescence in the conclusions of a minimizing theology,
look upon such discussions as having a tendency to divide the household
of faith and to divert attention from the activities of the Church.</p>

<p>There is, however, I am confident, a large class of men in and out of
the Church who would welcome a clear statement of the case of
Christianity in the light of current debate and to men of this class I
have great pleasure in commending the present volume.</p>

<p>The merit of these lectures consists largely in the fact that the author
takes a comprehensive survey of the latest phases of anti-Christian
thought, that he has a firm hold upon the central and vital questions
involved in the great debate, and that he does not allow himself to be
hampered by dealing needlessly with side issues. He is keen and
penetrating in his criticism of those who belittle the evidence in
support of revealed religion, and generous, sometimes to a fault, in his
appreciation of writers with whose dominant ideas he has but scant
sympathy. Of his learning and logical acumen there is no doubt and his
fairness in controversy is above reproach.</p>
<p>As the title of this volume suggests, we have no reason to fear that the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
Christian faith will suffer loss by reason of the fierce light of
criticism which now beats upon it. We must not undervalue learning nor
shrink from a searching scrutiny of our beliefs. The truth of
Christianity is not hard to discover when truth is sought through the
medium of normal vision. But our opponents must remember that when
inquiry is entered upon amid the blinding mists of philosophic
preconception and historic prejudice the best instruments of
investigation will fail to overcome the condition of "low visibility"
which confronts the seeker. The searchlight is of little use in a fog.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>


<p>A deep unsettlement of belief is characteristic
of our age. We prize the doubt
that low kinds and simpler ages existed
without; an interrogation point is held to be the
badge of mental superiority. While this unsettlement
is to be deplored when it leads, as it
does in so many cases, to the shipwreck of faith
and even of morals, there is yet a certain exhilaration
in living in a critical age. The challenge
to faith, meeting us at every point, rouses from
dogmatic slumber and dead orthodoxy. We
realize that the faith which is to survive must be
not simply a traditional faith, but an intelligent
faith, sending its roots down deep into reason
and experience, and blossoming upward in the
flowers and fruits of character and of good works.
As character receives its crown in the times of
persecution, so perhaps faith may grow strongest
in an age of doubt: it was the doubter among
the disciples who at last made the boldest confession
of faith. A restless age may at last heed
the invitation, "Come unto Me; I will give you
rest."</p>

<p>These lectures, delivered at Princeton Theological
Seminary in February, 1914, under the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
title of "The Christian Faith in the Light of
Modern Knowledge," have now been revised with
the addition of new matter. They were written in
the conviction that what Christianity has most
to fear is ignorance and prejudice and presupposition;
that the Christian Faith, with its motto,
"Come and see," welcomes the fullest investigation;
and that every advance in knowledge,
whatever temporary perplexities it may occasion,
will in the end reveal more fully the intrinsic excellence
of the Christian religion and establish
more firmly its sovereign claim to be from heaven
and not from men.</p>

<h3>What Is the Christian Faith?</h3>


<p>If every rational discussion, as Cicero has
said, should begin with a definition, it would
be well at the outset to try to answer the
question which forms the title of this lecture.
Of the definitions which may be given of the
Christian Faith two may be selected as typical:
(1) it is the faith in the providence and love of
God which Jesus exercised and exemplified; or
(2) it is the faith of which Jesus Himself is the
object. In the one case the essence of Christianity
will be found in the simple precepts of the
Peasant-Prophet of Galilee, in the other in the
developed Christology of the Apostle Paul.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that the average Christian will
not be satisfied with either of these definitions.
He looks to Jesus, it is true, as his Teacher and
Example, but he also trusts Him as his Redeemer
and worships Him as his Lord. The real question
at issue is whether original Christianity, the
religion which Jesus taught, was thus inclusive
of doctrine as well as ethics. Does Christianity
in its essence include Christology? The attempt
to answer this question will not only introduce
our general theme but will bring us into the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of it. It will be convenient to consider in order:
I. The Christianity of the New Testament Writers;
II. Primitive Christianity and Pauline Christianity;
III. The Christianity of Jesus and of Paul;
and IV. The Dilemma of Historical Criticism.</p>

<br>
<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Christianity of the New Testament
Writers</span></p>

<p>The scientific study of the New Testament
has brought clearly to light the individual traits
of the various writers, but has shown at the same
time the striking agreement of these writers in
their fundamental conception of the Christian
Faith. For those who set forth objectively the
words and ministry of Jesus as well as for those
who deal more explicitly with doctrinal interpretation,
the centre of interest lies in the Person,
the Passion and the Resurrection of Christ. It
may be well to illustrate this unity of standpoint,
while the fact of it is so generally conceded that
it needs no elaborate proof.</p>

<p>In the Apocalypse the sacrificial expression,
"the Lamb," occurs at least twenty-eight times;
and the central figure is that of the Lamb that
was slain but is now seated upon the throne.
In the First Epistle of John, Jesus is described as
the propitiation for sin (ii. 2; iv. 10), and as the
Son of God throughout the book. In First
Peter the readers are addressed as those who
have been begotten again to a living hope by<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
the Resurrection (i. 3), and redeemed by the
precious blood of Christ (i. 19). The Epistle to
the Hebrews is saturated with the language of
the sacrificial ritual, and describes the priestly
work of Christ who tasted death, put away sin,
and ever lives in the heavenly sanctuary to make
intercession. The Christological element is of
course very prominent in Paul's Epistles. According
to the Book of Acts, the Apostles
preached Jesus and the Resurrection (iv. 2;
xvii. 18, etc.). The death of Christ, mentioned
some thirteen times, the Resurrection, mentioned
or implied twenty times, and the forgiveness of
sins, mentioned in more or less close connection
with these eight times,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were the central themes
of apostolic preaching, which included in the
case of Peter, an eye-witness, the teaching and
mighty words of Jesus (ii. 22; x. 36-38).</p>

<p>In the Gospels it will be found that almost exactly
one-third of the textual material (in the
Westcott and Hort edition about eighty out of
the two hundred and forty pages) is taken up
with events connected with the Passion and
Resurrection, including the incidents and teachings
of the Passion week. In Luke the proportion
is somewhat smaller (some sixteen out of
seventy-three pages) than in the other Gospels;
but that the Passion is equally prominent in the
mind of the writer is shown by the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
shadow of it is projected back even to chapter
ix. 51, and that in Luke alone the "exodus" at
Jerusalem is the theme of conversation in the
Transfiguration scene (ix. 31). Even Mark,
showing least of all, it used to be said, the influence
of later theological reflection, has been
called a history of the Passion with an introduction.
As Harnack has said: "The whole
work of Mark is so disposed and composed that
death and resurrection appear as the aim of the
entire presentation."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The centre of interest for the Evangelists as
well as for Paul and the author of Hebrews is
Christ and Him crucified, the Passion and Resurrection.
It may be said, though, that the interest
of the Evangelists is a biographical one, an
interest in a beloved teacher or martyred leader,
comparable with that of Plato and Xenophon in
the last days and words of Socrates, and not a
distinctly theological interest such as Paul felt in
the death of Christ, as intimately connected with
his own experience of redemption from sin.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that the interest of the
Evangelists is not merely in the death but in the
resurrection of Jesus. It is worthy also of note
that the author of the Fourth Gospel and First
Epistle of John has shown that, to one New
Testament writer at least, description and interpretation
were equally important. John's description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of the death of Christ is as detailed and as
objective as that of the other Gospel writers; yet
his interpretation of the Passion as a propitiation
for sin (I John ii. 2; iv. 10) is the same as that of
the Apostle Paul. While John places the words
"Lamb of God" in the mouth of the Baptist
(i. 29, 36), and uses the expression, "the blood of
Jesus his Son who cleanses us from all sin"
(I John i. 7), he never, except possibly in a
veiled way, places the language of sacrifice in
the mouth of Jesus Himself. There is no reason
to doubt that the other Evangelists who record
the thrice repeated prediction of the Crucifixion
(see Mark viii. 31; ix. 12; x. 33, and parallels)
would, equally with John, be interested in its
doctrinal interpretation. Such an interpretation
is in fact suggested by the words of Jesus Himself.
At the Last Supper, He brought His death
into connection with the forgiveness of sins, and
when He spoke of it as a "ransom for many"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
used language which is naturally interpreted in a
sacrificial sense. Luke, it is true, nowhere uses
the word "ransom," but there is no reason to
doubt that he shared the Pauline view of the
death of Christ. This is clearly indicated by the
expression, "purchased with his own blood,"
contained in one of the "we-sections" of Acts
(xx. 28), and in fact by the words of the risen
Jesus (Luke xxiv. 46, 47). As the altar was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
central in the Old Testament, so, from the standpoint
of its writers, is the Passion in the New
Testament.</p>

<p>It is needless to show in detail that an exalted
view of the person of Christ is with the
New Testament writers connected with the central
place which they assign to His death and
resurrection. Mark, whose Christology is thought
to be least developed, may be taken as a single
example. In the opening scene of the ministry,
as in the Transfiguration scene, the divine voice
says: "Thou art (this is) my beloved Son"
(i. 11; ix. 7); and in the closing scene the centurion
exclaims, "Truly this man was the Son of
God" (or a son of God, Mark xv. 39). The
climax of the narrative is said to be the confession
of Peter, "Thou art the Christ" (viii. 29);
and Jesus alludes to Himself as "the Son," above
prophets and men and angels (xii. 6; xiii. 32).
At the trial, in answer to the solemn question of
the high priest, "Art thou the Christ, the Son of
the blessed?" He said, "I am" (xiv. 61-62).
Bousset admits that the three first Gospels differ
from the Fourth only in degree,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in his latest
work he says that if the phrase "Son of God"
(i. 1), omitted in many manuscripts of Mark, is
really an interpolation, it is a suitable one as indicating
the theme of the book.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Wrede even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
says the Gospel of Mark belongs in a sense to
the history of dogma.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>For the writers of the New Testament, leaving
out for the present the question of sources, in
spite of differences in time and place and race
and circumstances, and by implication for the
various circles of readers, Jewish, Greek and
Roman, whom they addressed, there was but one
kind of Christianity, one gospel of the Kingdom
and the Cross and the Son of God.</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Primitive Christianity and Pauline
Christianity</span></p>

<p>It is asserted that the striking unanimity of the
New Testament writers in their view of Christianity
is not due to the teaching of Jesus, but to
the powerful influence of the Apostle Paul. The
statement is made in many quarters that not
Jesus but Paul was the virtual founder of Christianity,
so far as its central doctrines, its institutions,
its worship of a divine Christ, and its
world-wide propaganda are concerned. In Paul,
it is said, the gospel of a simple piety and a pure
ethic, the gospel of Jesus, was so overlaid by the
incrustations of dogma that its true nature was
hidden until rediscovered by modern criticism;
and it had thus lost the simplicity that is in
Christ. It was Paul himself, whose missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
labours carried the gospel throughout Europe,
that really preached "another gospel." As
Schweitzer, following Kalthoff, suggests with
some irony, there was, under this supposition,
"an immediate declension from and falsification
of a pure original principle" in Christianity,
comparable only to the Fall in the moral history
of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The teaching of the primitive apostles is sometimes
declared to be an intermediate step between
the gospel of Jesus and the doctrinal Christianity
of Paul. It is desirable then to compare
the Pauline teaching, first with the teaching of
the other apostles and the Jerusalem church, and
then with the teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p>When we examine the historical situation, the
lines of connection between Paul and the primitive
apostles and the Jerusalem church are so
many and so strong as practically to negative
the supposition of a fundamental difference between
them in their conception of the gospel.</p>

<p>(1) If Luke had written the Fourth Gospel,
the case would be different; but Luke wrote
(assuming his authorship of the Third Gospel
and the Acts)<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the Gospel which contains the
Sermon on the Mount and the parables of the
Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. When
one remembers that Luke was the intimate companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of Paul and his co-labourer in missionary
work before he wrote his Gospel, that he derived
his material largely from "eye-witnesses of the
word," and that afterwards he recorded the
teaching of both Peter and Paul in the Acts, it is
clear that Luke himself saw no essential difference
between the Christianity of the primitive
apostles and that of Paul, and it becomes improbable
that such a difference existed.</p>

<p>(2) Paul took with him on his missionary
journeys Barnabas and Silas, accredited leaders
and representatives of the primitive Jerusalem
church (Acts xiii. 2f.; xv. 40). Paul's work for
years was carried on under the surveillance of
these men, and Barnabas stood sponsor for Paul
before the Jerusalem authorities (Acts xv. 12).
The close connection of these two men with both
parties excludes the supposition of any radical
difference in their doctrines.</p>

<p>(3) Paul's Christology was accepted by his
Jewish-Christian opponents at Jerusalem, and
never questioned by them. Paul we know to
have been bitterly assailed by a Pharisaic party
in the Jerusalem church. They dogged his steps
wherever he went; they impugned his orthodoxy
from the Mosaic standpoint; they called in question
his apostleship and his sincerity. But it is
significant that they never assailed as an innovation
the Christological views in which he is
supposed to differ from them. "Certain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
James" (Gal. ii. 12), in the bitter polemic over
circumcision, never accused Paul, as they would
have done if his views were different in this respect,
of a declension from Jewish monotheism.
Paul doubtless used the name current in Jerusalem
when he spoke, in a context in which he
puts Christ above men and above angels and on
an equality with God as a source of grace, of
"James, the Lord's brother" (Gal. i. 3, 12, 19).
He used the same titles as did those at Jerusalem,
and a difference in Christological dogma
can only be made out by saying that the names
are used in different senses.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This is to admit
that the difference discovered by modern critical
acumen was so small as not to be recognized by
either party at the time. In Paul's controversial
encounter with Peter, in a context full of the
characteristic Pauline ideas of Justification, of
the Cross, of the indwelling Christ, and of Jesus
as the Son of God, Paul appealed to the essential
unity of their Christian faith and experience
(Gal. ii. 11-21).</p>

<p>(4) Paul asserts the identity of his gospel
with that of the primitive apostles as well known
to his readers. He preached the faith of which
he once made havoc (Gal. i. 23). His gospel of
a crucified and risen Christ, he declares, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
"received," not invented (I Cor. xv. 3), was in
accordance with Jewish Scriptures, and the inference
is unavoidable that it was held and
taught in common by Peter and James, the Jerusalem
leaders. Both Peter and Paul taught
Jesus and the Resurrection (Acts ii. 31; xiii. 34;
xvii. 31); and as Harnack says, there is no reason
to doubt the representations of the first chapter
of the Acts as to early apostolic belief.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Resurrection is emphasized alike in the
speeches of Peter in Acts and in the First Epistle
(I Peter i. 3; ii. 24; iii. 21). In Romans the Resurrection
is mentioned seven times (i. 4; iv. 25;
vi. 4; vii. 4; viii. 34; x. 9; xiv. 9), and enters
into the warp and woof of Paul's teaching. The
thought of Paul is doubtless more systematic
and constructive, but it is unnatural to believe
either that Paul had a different view of the nature
of the Resurrection, or that he drew doctrinal
inferences from it which the other apostles would
not accept.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is hard to see, moreover, how
the theory that Paul's teaching was essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
different from that of the Jerusalem church, and
the theory that Paul profoundly influenced all of
the New Testament writers can consistently be
held at the same time.</p>

<br>
<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Christianity of Jesus and of
Paul</span></p>

<p>A more serious question meets us when we
come to the relation of Paul's teaching to that of
Jesus Himself. Behind the writers of the New
Testament and behind the teaching of the apostles,
is there not in the authentic words of Jesus
as determined by criticism a simpler gospel of
the love of God and the duty of man, from which
Christology and the doctrines of the Cross are
excluded? May we not "lighten the distressed
ship of the gospel" by casting overboard its
cargo of doctrine? Harnack thinks that we
may; and in his famous lectures on the "Essence
of Christianity" has set forth the seeming anomaly
of the gospel of Christ with Christology
omitted, a gospel which includes only the Father
and not the Son.</p>

<p>The essence of Christianity according to Paul
would be contained in the statements, "While we
were yet sinners Christ died for us" (Rom. v. 8);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"God was in Christ reconciling the world"
(2 Cor. v. 19); "He loved me and gave himself
for me" (Gal. ii. 20). Paul's gospel was the
gospel of Christ and Him crucified. The essence
of Christianity according to Harnack consists
in the truths of the fatherly love of God and
the value of the individual soul. It is indeed a
gospel preached by Christ, but in the content of
its message is the Father only&mdash;not the Son.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The contrast thus asserted suggests the need of
a closer examination of the relation of Jesus and
Paul.</p>

<p>Nothing is more striking in the comparison
between Jesus and Paul than the difference in
their personality and yet the similarity in their
ethical teaching. Jesus was a Galilean, born in
humble circumstances, belonging to the peasant
or working class, a stranger to the training of
the schools, a "layman," and an Oriental in His
mode of thought and expression. Paul was a
native of Tarsus, a Greek city which was noted
as the seat of a philosophical school; his father
was a man of consequence, a Roman citizen, who
gave his son the best education that the Jewish
schools could afford. He was a typical member
of the proudest caste of a proud nation, proud of
his race, of his learning, of his strictness in religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and his zeal for the Law (Phil. iii. 6),
trained in the refinements of Rabbinical dialectic,
but an Occidental in his method of
thought. Yet in ethics Paul stands very near
to Jesus. Both emphasized the same virtues,
and these the very virtues most foreign to Paul's
early Græco-Roman environment and his later
Pharisaic prejudice. Where Jesus said, "Blessed
are the poor in spirit," Paul, blameless in the law,
said, "Boasting is excluded. By grace are ye
saved" (Rom. iii. 27; Eph. ii. 5). Where Jesus
said, "He that exalteth himself shall be humbled"
(Luke xviii. 14), Paul, the Pharisee, said, "In lowliness
of mind let each esteem other better than
themselves" (Phil. ii. 3). Where Jesus said, "Love
your enemies," Paul, the persecutor now the persecuted,
repeated the command so foreign to
the moral ideals of his time (Rom. xii. 20). Both
taught that in the command to love one's neighbour
was a summary of the moral law (Rom.
xiii. 10; Matt. xxii. 38, 39).</p>

<p>Paul's great ethical passages, such as Romans
xii. and I Corinthians xiii., are but republications
in Pauline language of the Sermon on the Mount.
In moral teaching Jesus and Paul are at one, although
there can be no doubt which was the originator
of the Christian philosophy of life. Jesus
whose code was but the transcript of His character
is the original; and Paul, conformed in thought
and spirit to the image of Jesus, was the echo.</p>

<p>But Paul's moral teaching was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
merely an echo or reminiscence of the ethics of
Jesus; it was organically connected with his own
doctrinal teaching. In Paul's letters there is usually
an ethical section, but this is preceded by a
didactic or doctrinal section. Doctrine with him,
in the words of Phillips Brooks, was the "child
of faith and the mother of duty." Admittedly
his doctrine is used to enforce and to inspire his
ethics. A high Christology&mdash;"Christ also pleased
not himself" (Rom. xv. 3)&mdash;enforces the appeal
not to please oneself. The Incarnation is the
supreme example of generosity to the poor, and
the death upon the Cross of lowliness of mind
and obedience (2 Cor. viii. 9; Phil. ii. 5-8). His
own sacrifice for our sins grounds the plea for a
life of unselfishness (2 Cor. v. 14, 15; Rom. xii. 1).
We should walk in love as Christ loved us and
gave Himself for us (Eph. v. 2); and should walk
in newness of life, as Christ was raised from the
dead by the glory of the Father (Rom. vi. 4).
Doctrine with Paul and ethics in its solemn sanctions
and its inspiring motivation are inextricably
intertwined. Paul's doctrine about the person
of Christ and His death and resurrection can
be disentangled from his ethical teaching as little
as it can from his experience. Certainly the doctrine
was no alien or extraneous element in Paul's
system, and certainly it strengthened rather than
weakened his ethical appeal.</p>

<p>Is there a similar blending of ethics and doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in the teaching of Jesus? For the gospel
of Jesus in its purity we must, according to a
popular school of criticism, go back of the
Fourth Gospel to the Synoptics, and back of
these to their sources, practically to Mark and
to the source called Q (Quelle), or the Logia,
representing the non-Markan agreements of
Matthew and Luke. Even in these sources, it
is often maintained, caution must be used, and
foreign elements must be eliminated. Let us
see, then, whether there is such a mingling of
the ethical and the Christological in the authentic
teaching of Jesus as we have noticed in that of
Paul. The Sermon on the Mount, the words to
the disciples after the confession of Peter (Mark
viii. 34-38), and the teaching on true greatness
(Mark x. 42-45), may be taken as typical examples
of Jesus' ethical teaching. In these passages
are not merely disconnected maxims, but
an ethical system, containing a profound and,
as we may say, fully thought out philosophy of
life, in which the religious and ethical elements
are organically united.</p>

<p>The Beatitudes begin with passive virtue,
humility, meekness, longing for righteousness;
they pass on to the possession of righteousness
and purity of heart; ascend to works of active
benevolence; and culminate in a character so
positive and pronounced in goodness as to excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
opposition from the forces of evil. At least one
element in the consciousness of Jesus as He
spoke these words may be compared with the
Christological standpoint of Paul. The impression
which His teaching made upon His hearers
is summed up in the words: "He taught them
as one having authority" (Matt. vii. 29). If we
seek to analyze this authority, we find it to be,
first, the authority of perfect moral insight. A
flaw discovered in the character of a teacher
easily neutralizes the force of his moral appeal.
The ethic of Jesus is not merely a system of
rules, but the blending of a code which has
guided human progress and a character in
which men have found their supreme ideal of
moral excellence. His sureness of touch, His
clearness of moral insight, His transparent
beauty of character, betray a consciousness
unique among men. The verdict of mankind
as they have studied the character of Jesus, and
studied themselves in the light of it, is that that
character is as much a miracle in the moral
sphere,&mdash;that is, opposed to a uniform experience&mdash;as
is the birth from a virgin, for example, in
the physical sphere. The consciousness of Jesus,
at the very least, must have been profoundly
influenced by the fact, assuming it to be a fact,
that He alone among the children of men did
perfectly the will of the Father.</p>

<p>The authority of Jesus, again, was that of a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
lawgiver from whose words there could be no
appeal. His words superseded all previous legislation,
in the sense of completing it, and all
current interpretation. The imperial "I say
unto you" implied the power, not simply of
judicial interpretation, but of repealing old laws
and enacting new ones. Nor was His teaching
in His own conception of it a mere phase, albeit
the highest at the time, of moral development.
His legislation was final, and never to be superseded;
and obedience to it, or neglect of it, was
to be the decisive factor in human welfare and
destiny (Matt. vii. 24-27).</p>

<p>But the authority of Jesus was not merely that
of a lawgiver. He inaugurated the Kingdom
whose coming He proclaimed and whose laws
He formulated, and He is to be the final judge
of the worthiness of its members. These members
were not merely pious Jews in general or
John's disciples, but were His disciples. They
were the light of the world because they were
His disciples, and the crowning element in their
character was endurance of persecution for His
sake (Matt. v. 11, "for my sake"; Luke vi. 22,
"for the Son of man's sake"). His teaching
instead of pointing away from Himself to God,
in the spirit of the other wisest teachers of men,
pointed to Himself as the One by whom fully
and finally God's will and purpose were to be
made known. He plainly taught or clearly implied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that men's relations to Himself as Teacher,
Lord, Lawgiver and Judge, were supremely important
for human destiny (Matt. vii. 21-24).</p>

<p>No words in the ethical-religious message of
Jesus are more striking in form and thought, and
no others have more deeply impressed the minds
of men, than those in which He asserted that the
value of the soul outweighs all earthly good:
"What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the
whole world and lose his own soul?" These
words, says Eucken, have given the soul a
history. In the startling paradox in the context,
"He that saveth his life shall lose it," we have
the saying of Jesus most often repeated in the
Gospels, occurring six times, and assigned to
four different occasions (Mark viii. 35; Matt.
x. 39; xvi. 25; Luke ix. 24; xvii. 33; John
xii. 25).</p>

<p>The study of these sayings in their context
(Mark viii. 34-38 and parallels) shows that the
thought which was uppermost in the mind of
Jesus, and in fact dominated at this point the
ethical teaching, was precisely that of His own
person and death and resurrection. His question
to Peter, "Whom say ye that I am?"
(Mark viii. 29) shows that He was dissatisfied
with the title of prophet given Him by others,
and that He would draw from the disciples a
confession that they had come to hold a higher
view of His mission. When Peter, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to the accounts in Mark and Matthew, refused to
accept the prediction of His death, He showed
that it was necessary for all His disciples to take
up the cross and follow Him. The goal of life
is to be reached only by those who follow Him
in spirit in His death and resurrection, and confess
Him before men. The losing of the highest
in life is for those who are ashamed of Him in
this generation. The destiny of men hinges
upon their relation to Himself. The connection
between the most oft-repeated and self-authenticating
maxims of Jesus and His own person,
death, and resurrection is as clear and organic
as the connection between the ethical and doctrinal,
or Christological, teaching of Paul.</p>

<p>It remains to consider the passage (Mark x.
42-45; Matt. xx. 25-28) on true greatness and
service. Here we have a characteristic teaching
of Jesus cutting athwart the ordinary opinion of
mankind. But the maxim, "Whosoever would
become great among you," is connected with
Himself as the example of true greatness. He,
the teacher and example of humility, refers to
Himself as the supreme illustration of true greatness.
His death is the supreme expression of
self-sacrifice for the good of others, and in it by
implication is the highest service done to man.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Ethics and doctrine about Himself and His
death are as inextricably blended in this saying
of Jesus as in Paul's statement, "Though
he was rich yet for your sakes became poor," or
John's, "He laid down his life for us and we
ought to lay down our lives for the brethren"
(2 Cor. viii. 9; I John iii. 16). In His deepest
ethical teaching Jesus points not away from Himself,
as do other moral teachers. His words in
the Synoptics are not essentially different from
those in John: "If I your Lord and teacher have
washed your feet, you ought also to wash one
another's feet" (xiii. 14).</p>

<p>The Christology of Jesus finds expression in
the familiar words in Matthew xi. 25-30 (Luke
x. 21, 22): "All things have been delivered unto
me of my Father, etc." These words are often
spoken of as the climax of His self-revelation
in the Synoptic Gospels, and modern criticism
unites with Christian devotion in recognizing
their importance. The conviction is growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that the words, as they stand in all the Greek
texts, cannot have been the utterance of a merely
human Jesus, the pattern of truthfulness and the
example of humility.</p>

<p>A few examples will show the trend of recent
interpretation. Plummer thinks that the self-revelation
of Jesus in the expression, "All things
were delivered unto Me, etc.," "contains the
whole of the Christology of the Fourth Gospel;"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and he believes that the aorist verb "points back
to a moment in eternity, and implies the preëxistence
of the Messiah."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Critical acumen, says Lemme, may seek to
empty the saying of its content, but "there remains
the exclusiveness of the mediatorial work
of Jesus for the totality of mankind, there remains
the absolute uniqueness of His redemption,
there remains His lonely elevation above
the entire realm of the human, there remains His
unique fellowship of life with the Father, which
enabled Him, and Him alone, to know God adequately,
or, what is the same thing, to reveal the
truth. We must take our choice: such an utterance
is either the delirium of a reckless self-exaltation,
or the appropriate testimony of a divine
Being demanding unreserved faith."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The logion has been made the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
an exhaustive monograph by Schumacher, who
concludes that the reciprocal knowledge of the
Father and the Son implies the consciousness of
divine Sonship in a full metaphysical sense.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In his lectures on the "Essence of Christianity,"
Harnack takes the text as it stands, but, ignoring
the implications of reciprocal knowledge, says:
"The consciousness he possessed of being the
Son of God is, therefore, nothing but the practical
consequence of knowing God as the Father
and as His Father. Rightly understood, the
name of Son means nothing but the knowledge
of God."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In his critique of Harnack, Loisy
objects to this interpretation as being "artificial
and superficial,"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and says: "Obviously the text
indicates a transcendental relationship, whence
springs the lofty dignity of Christ, and not a
psychological reality, which in regard to God is
clearly impossible. Father and Son are not here
simply religious terms, but have already become
metaphysical theological expressions, and dogmatic
speculation has been able to take possession
of them, without much modification of their
sense."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Loisy takes the meaning as fundamentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the same as John i. 18, and cannot accept
it in the form we have it as a genuine word
of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In his "Sayings of Jesus," Harnack omits
from the text, on what seem to be slender grounds,
the first clause of the parallel, "No one knoweth
the Son but the Father."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He candidly admits,
however, that if the text stands no fair exegesis
can prevent a Christological reference. It must
mean "a relationship of Father and Son which
never had a beginning, but remains ever the
same." "We cannot by any method of interpretation
make it much less metaphysical."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Bousset, who in his "Jesus" (1904) accepted
the utterance as spoken by Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> now sees in it
the expression of a high Christology. He believes,
against Harnack, that the expression, "All
things have been delivered to me," refers to
power, not simply to knowledge; and, retaining
both clauses expressing reciprocal knowledge of
the Father and the Son, he finds in this "majestic
self-testimony" in its present form the work of
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We may speak, then, of a consensus of opinion
in the recent interpretation of this saying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Jesus. When we remember that the verbal
resemblance between Matthew xi. 25-27 and
Luke x. 21, 22 is remarkably close, and that the
saying thus belongs to the earliest strata of
Gospel tradition, that is, to the conjectural "Q,"
it is significant that the minute examination to
which it has been subjected has convinced critics
of different dogmatic standpoints that they can
only interpret it in a high Christological sense.
It is agreed that the words as they stand
imply the preëxistence of the Messiah, a relation
which can properly be called "metaphysical"
between the Father and the Son, and a unique
relation to men as the only bearer of the full
revelation of God. The saying, often called an
"aerolite from the Johannine heavens" (Hase),
contains in a nutshell, if taken with verses 28-30,
the teaching of the fourteenth chapter of John,
revealing Jesus in similar relation alike to God
and to men, and as supplying all the deepest
needs of men. Sanday has even said that "we
might describe the teaching of the Fourth Gospel
as a series of variations upon the one theme which
has its classical expression in a verse of the
Synoptics. 'All things have been delivered unto
me, etc'"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It has been argued that the saying of Jesus,
Johannine in style and substance, is so isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in the Synoptic narrative that, in spite of its
secure position in the sources, doubts of its
genuineness must arise. Bousset employs this
argument, remarking that the thoughts of our
logion "in the remaining Synoptic tradition are
scarcely found at all."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is noticeable, however,
that the isolation is established only by cutting
away a large portion of the Synoptic material.
The parable of the Vineyard, in which Jesus
speaks of Himself as a beloved son, the heir
(Mark xii. 6, 7), is objected to because "never
thus did Jesus elsewhere in His parables force His
person into the foreground."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The Markan saying
in which Jesus distinguishes Himself, as Son,
from men and angels (xiii. 32) is set aside;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the
filial consciousness implied in the repeated use by
Jesus of the expressions, "My Father," "your
Father," "the Father," but never "our Father,"
is attributed to later theological reflection,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and
the narratives of the divine voice at the Baptism
and the Transfiguration are discredited. Similarly
the incidental claims which Jesus makes for
Himself in forgiving sin, in speaking of Himself
as the "Bridegroom," the Physician who came to
cure the moral ills of men, and as Lord of the
Sabbath, are all referred to secondary strata of
tradition or to dogmatic overworking of the
facts.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>


<p>So drastic is the process by which Bousset
attempts to reduce the consciousness of Jesus to
a purely human level that he even rejects the
major part of the narrative of the Trial and
Crucifixion. Whatever differences there may be
in detail, there is no room for doubt that the
charge upon which Jesus was put to death is
correctly given by John. "We have a law,
and by that law he ought to die, because he
made himself the Son of God" (John xix. 7).
We may believe that the result would have been
different if for one moment He had disclaimed
divine prerogatives, and said, "I am of thy
brethren the prophets: worship God."</p>

<p>If it be denied that Jesus made these claims
before and at His trial, the cause of His death is
unknown. This is admitted by Bousset, who rejects
the whole account of the trial, including the
question of Pilate, "Art thou the King of the
Jews?" (Mark xv. 2), and the title on the cross,
retaining only the accusation that He said "I
will destroy this temple" (Mark xiv. 58; xv. 29).
Apart from this concrete accusation, not in itself
sufficient, because not blasphemy "in the strict
juristic sense of the word," it is admitted that
"we cannot say any more with exactness why
Jesus was condemned by Pilate."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the answer
of Jesus to the high priest, telling of the Son of
Man "sitting at the right hand of power, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
coming with the clouds of heaven," it is said that
"we hear directly the Christian confession,
'seated on the right hand of God, from whence He
shall come to judge the quick and the dead.'"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
It is to be noted that these passages, implying in
Bousset's opinion the substitution of the "day"
of Jesus for the Old Testament "day of Jahweh,"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and implying the metaphysics of the creeds, are
to be found in Mark, not in John, and in the narrative
of the trial of Jesus, not in that of His
resurrection.</p>

<p>The "isolation" of the great passage in Matthew
and Luke, as to its essential content, is thus
made out only by a thoroughgoing process of
elimination running through the whole story of
the Gospels. Every page of the Gospels testifies,
in fact, to Jesus' consciousness of a unique relation
to God and to men; and an examination of
His teaching in whatever part or whatever context
confirms the judgment of von Dobschütz that
"Jesus implicitly stands everywhere in the centre
of His gospel. The 'I am He,' which is recognized
as the leading motive of the Fourth Gospel,
runs through all His words also in the
Synoptics."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The self-revelation of Jesus and
the great invitation of Matthew xi. 25-30 may be
the climax of Synoptic teaching as to the relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of Jesus alike to the Father and to mankind (unless
the words of the risen Christ, Matt. xxviii.
18-20, are so regarded), but the passage is no
alien or intrusive element in its context. If it is
the high point of Synoptic teaching, it is the capstone
of a pyramid firmly and broadly supported
by the whole Synoptic narrative.</p>

<p>Carlyle has said that the greatness of a character
is measured by the contrasts it exhibits.
The words of Jesus we have been studying, taken
in their entirety and in their context, show the
contrasts between knowledge and humility, between
power and humility, and, when the woes
on the cities are contrasted with the invitation,
"Come unto me," between sternness and tenderness.
When Socrates was told by the oracle
that he was the wisest of men, he was in perplexity
for a time, but finally decided that he was
wise because he recognized his own ignorance.
In His knowledge of the Father and in the mystery
of His own person, Jesus places Himself on
an equality with God. Yet this knowledge did
not "puff up." There was no need with Jesus
as with Peter for the moment of spiritual insight
to be followed by a rebuke for presumption; nor
did He need like Paul, because of the greatness
of the revelation, to have the thorn in the flesh
lest He be exalted above measure. These contrasts,
not found in any other historical character,
are a self-authenticating feature of the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Jesus. All of His actions, in fact, and all of His
attitudes towards men, whether they were friends
or foes, and all His words, whether of compassion,
forgiveness, warning or indignation, were
those of a "Prince and a Saviour," a Prince in
majesty and power and a Saviour in pity. Both
deeds and words showed that union of qualities
which it would be impossible to invent, "the
self-assertion of the great example of humility."</p>
<br>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The Dilemma of Historical Criticism</span></p>

<p>An indirect evidence of transcendent elements
in the consciousness of Jesus, and of the
essential harmony between His teaching and
that of Paul, is furnished by the increasingly
skeptical tendency of liberal criticism and the
complete skepticism in which that criticism has
culminated. We must discount, say the extreme
Liberal critics in effect, the Ascension and Resurrection
narratives, because they were written under
the belief that Jesus was the exalted Son of
God. We must discount the Passion narrative
because dominated by the belief that Jesus was
and claimed to be the Messiah; we must discount
the miracles, and must take from the Gospel page
everything that indicates that Jesus claimed divine
prerogatives, or Messianic honours, or used
titles such as "the Christ," "the Son of God,"
"Lord," or even "the Son of Man," because
these betray the dogmatic views of the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
But why not go further with the "mythical"
school and discount the whole narrative because
written under the prepossession that Jesus was
an historical character? If the faith of the
Church&mdash;"the enemy of history"&mdash;has been able
to create those features in the portrait of Christ
which have been regarded as significant for religion
during the ages of Christendom, why cannot
its creative activity have extended to the
historical foundation? Why could it not have
created its portrait of Jesus out of nothing, or at
least out of the social strivings and religious
needs and practices of a syncretic age?</p>

<p>The mythical hypothesis, it is clear, is not a
mere eccentricity of criticism. It is more than
an effort of youthful audacity in scholarship
striving to gain public attention. It is the natural,
if not the inevitable, outcome of the direction
in which criticism, discarding more and
more of the Gospel narrative, and deserting
more and more, it may be said, the sure ground
of historical evidence, has been moving. The
method of a progressive reduction of the sources
and elimination of unacceptable material has
been only pushed by the Radicals to an extreme.
The Radicals, avowedly basing themselves on
the Liberals, contend that the latter have stopped
at an untenable half-way position. Thus Drews
says that since the days of Strauss doubts of the
historical existence of Jesus have never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
lulled to rest;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and Reinach, avoiding Drews'
extreme, yet declares that "it is contrary to every
sound method to compose, as Renan did, a life
of Jesus, eliminating the marvellous elements of
the Gospel story. It is no more possible to
make real history with myths than to make
bread with the pollen of flowers."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It was
thought that an irreducible minimum had been
reached in Schmiedel's famous nine "foundation-pillars"
for a scientific life of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but
even these are shattered by the modern critical
artillery.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>When Schmiedel finds the bed-rock of historical
truth in a few expressions or incidents which
run counter to the general intention of the Gospel
writers, it is open to W. B. Smith to base an
elaborate argument upon a single phrase or even
word "the things concerning Jesus," or "the
Jesus," Acts xviii. 25; xxviii. 21, etc., in favour of a
pre-Christian Jesus-cult.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> And when Bousset with
the Gospels before him confesses that we cannot
know certainly why Jesus was put to death, it is
open for Frazer and Reinach to transform the
Crucifixion into a sort of Haman-and-Mordecai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
play;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> or even for J. M. Robertson, criticizing
Frazer, to say that the capital error of the latter
is in the postulate that Jesus existed at all.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It
must be confessed that there is a facile descent
from the "reduced Christianity" of the extreme
Liberals to the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the Radicals,
and that the difference between them is
often one of degree rather than of principle. The
astringents used to remove the brilliant colours of
miracle and transcendence have proved so strong
as to destroy the portrait they were intended to
restore. By proposing the dilemma, A miraculous
Christ or a mythical Christ, the Radicals
have shown the difficulty of drawing the picture
of an historical Jesus from which the transcendent
elements have been removed. It should be noticed
further that the "historical" Jesus who is
left has a diminishing importance for religion, and
even for ethics. When Jesus is reduced to the
level of mere humanity, that humanity is apt to
be of an inferior order. He accepts the title and
rôle of Messiah unwillingly, as a burden and under
compulsion from His followers, or under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
strong delusion that, defeated in His earthly
mission, He would immediately come in glory.
In either case there is an element of weakness,
whether intellectual or moral, in His character; He
cannot be the supreme example and moral leader
of humanity. Or else, relieved of the Messianic
burden in the imagination of the critic, He becomes
a "warrior for the truth,"<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> a sort of Galilean
Socrates, the wisest and best of men, but
with no clear outlines in His personality and no
distinctive traits in His message.</p>

<p>Whether the Founder of the Christian religion
be pictured as "merely a pious preacher of morality
in the sense of present day liberalism,"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> or a
"psychopathic anomaly," obsessed with the idea
that He was the Messiah, the picture is not convincing
to the historian any more than it is consoling
to the Christian. In neither picture can
the Christ of the Gospels or the Christ of Christian
experience be recognized. Matters are not
mended when extremes meet, and Jesus is pictured
as at once the sunny and serene Galilean
pietist, and the rapt ecstatic obsessed by the
thought of His own immediate and glorious return&mdash;a
deluded enthusiast who saw life steadily
and saw it whole. If the representation is not
that of a moral or mental weakling, below the
level of the normal in clearness of outlook upon
life or in sincerity and decision of character, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
are left with a largely imaginary figure, from
which most of the concrete features have been
removed. We do not know what manner of man
He was, nor, it must be acknowledged, does it
matter very much for religion whether He was at
all; for with the increasing vagueness in the historical
portrait of Jesus, there comes inevitably a
weakening of His influence as a teacher whether
of religion or morals.</p>

<p>His gospel, in the first place, was never intended
to become universal, since the Gentile
mission is attributed to the influence of later
ecclesiastical ideas. But is not the content of
Jesus' religious teaching, the Fatherhood of God
and the value of the soul, unaffected by any views
which are held as to His Person? Tendencies
are observable in modern thought which are not
reassuring upon this point; and, in fact, the history
of thought shows that theism, apart from the
support of Christian doctrine, is apt to pass into
a pantheistic mysticism or a semi-deistic naturalism.
The Fatherhood of God may be regarded
as too anthropomorphic a conception,
and a semi-pantheistic "all-Father" may be substituted
for the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Strauss, while he is the classical example,
is not alone in this passage from Liberal
Christianity to a more complete skepticism which
gives up theistic belief. It is not surprising that
in certain circles the expression "Christian pantheism"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
is now heard, and that a sympathetic attitude
towards pantheism should be shown by the
Liberal critic. Thus J. Weiss says: "Pantheism
may, indeed, have its limitations and defects, yet,
without doubt, it lies very near to our time, inspired
as it is by both scientific and artistic ideas.
Why should we not recognize this form of religious
life alongside of other forms, in case it
finds vital expression in emotion and action?"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the theistic content of
Jesus' teaching is immeasurably strengthened
when enforced by His divine authority, and read
in the light of His Incarnation, Passion and
Resurrection. As Drews remarks: "The chief
obstacle to a monistic religion and attitude is the
belief irreconcilable with reason or history, in the
historical reality of a 'unique,' ideal, and unsurpassable
redeemer."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Certainly the assurance
that God is a loving Father and that we are His
children, said to be the essence of Christianity,
is wonderfully safeguarded and buttressed by
the doctrines, or facts, of an Incarnate, Crucified,
and Risen Christ.</p>

<p>Whatever happens to the Christian doctrines
and the Christian history, many will declare that
the ethical teaching of Jesus will remain, and will
continue to exercise its empire over the lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
men. But such an inference finds little support
in present conditions. An aggressive militarism
maintains that each nation should be free to
develop its own religious ideas, and chides
Strauss with half-way measures in holding to
Christian ethics while discarding Christian doctrines
and miracles. A militant feminism which
objects to the marriage service, and a militant
socialism which sees in the family the main
support of the right of private property, will not,
if they have their way, leave the marriage relation
unaffected. Jesus taught, we are reminded,
in a pre-scientific and a pre-Darwinian age. His
teaching, in fact, whatever its acknowledged
excellence and importance, was but a phase, and
that not the final phase, of moral evolution.
His teaching, as many hold, was only an <i>Interimsethik</i>,
not intended to be the norm for all
men and all time. There is no assurance that
even the character of Christ will remain undimmed
in splendour, and undiminished in
power of appeal, for there is no evidence for
sinlessness, except evidence which is rejected on
the ground of exaggeration or idealization in the
case of miracles, and other claims implying the
supernatural. Christian ethics doubtless makes
an appeal of its own, but apart from the support
of Christology its supremacy is by no means
assured. If we go back to the moral teaching
or to the example of Jesus alone, there will be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
teaching with authority, no divine Teacher who
is the Truth, and no regenerative power of
the Spirit behind the teaching. The power of
Christ's example lies in the union of humility
and authority. "Take Christ's difference from
us out of Christianity and His identity with us
loses all its glorious power." If their Lord and
Master washes the disciples' feet, the example
comes with the force of a divine command: "Ye
ought also to wash one another's feet." It is not
merely a beautiful act to be admired (or perhaps
by some to be despised); it is a divine imperative
to be obeyed.</p>

<p>The strongest argument for a doctrinal Christianity
is not the indirect one to be found in the
lessening significance of a merely human-historical
Jesus, and the tendency of His figure to
become dim upon the field of history, and of His
voice to die away as an echo over the Judean
hills. It is rather to be found in the positive
evidence of the Christian documents, in the
testimony of Christian experience, and in the
broader effects of a doctrinal Christianity in the
course of the centuries.</p>

<p>The statements of Harnack in his later essays
show the inadequacy of a gospel which does not
include in its content the Person of the Redeemer.
"Only God is the Redeemer&mdash;and
yet Christendom calls Jesus of Nazareth its Redeemer.
How is this contradiction to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
solved?"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is a fact that He is the inner
possession of His own. "But that which lies
behind this fact, which is expressed in the confession
'Christ liveth in me,' the persuasion of
the eternal life of Christ, of His power and glory,
that is a secret of the faith which mocks all explanation."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
When there is such a contradiction
between experience and theory, it will be
natural to question the adequacy of a theory
which finds no interpretation for the deepest
experiences of religion. Harnack, indeed, goes
far towards admitting the harmony between the
gospel of Jesus and that of Paul when he says:
"The 'first' gospel contains the truth, the
'second' [Paul's gospel of redemption] the way,
and both together the life."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>There is in essence but one gospel, differently
presented by Jesus and Paul, whose focal point
in the teaching of both is Christ and Him crucified.
The differences, as shown by von Dobschütz
in a notable essay, explain themselves
naturally from the situation. In John and Paul
there is only expansion and repetition of what
was contained implicitly in the words of Jesus in
the Synoptists. The later time was not creative,
but only selected and developed; its message was
an echo, not a new utterance. In the teaching
of Paul as compared with that of Jesus there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
three points of difference: (1) the person of Jesus
is much more strongly emphasized; (2) His death
and resurrection appear as basal redemptive acts;
and (3) everything is brought into connection
with redemption from sin. All three of these
differences are explained by the historical situation.
Jesus Himself had brought them to God,
and His resurrection had brought them out of
their despair and strengthened their faith and
given them courage for preaching. As to the
differences, two considerations should be borne
in mind: "That the gospel should be differently
set forth before the death of Jesus than it was
after that event is not to be wondered at; and,
secondly, it is also natural that the standpoint
and exposition of the recipients of grace should
be different from the attitude of One who was
free from sin, and knew that He was sent to
bring man to God."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In the future as in the past, we may believe,
doctrinal Christianity, that is a Christianity broad
enough to include the teaching and example, and
the person and passion and resurrection of Christ,
will be for men and nations the power of God
unto salvation. If the essence of a thing is
shown in its activity, the essence of Christianity
cannot be separated from its doctrinal content.
Certainly it was Christianity in a doctrinal form<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
that inspired the greatest achievements of the
Christian Church in the course of her history.
It was doctrinal Christianity that loosed the
bonds of Jewish legalism, inspired the missionary
enterprise of the primitive and the modern
church, raised the standard of the Reformation,
laid the foundations of modern democracy, and
guided the sanest and bravest attempts at social
reform.</p>

<p>Our argument has been that the primitive
gospel which began to be preached by the Lord
was a doctrinal gospel, a gospel of the Kingdom,
the Cross and the Son of God, that no other
message can be found with any distinctness
within or beneath the Gospel records, and that
this has been at the basis of Christian experience
and of the life of the Christian Church. The
gospel of the grace of God is the gospel of the
glory of Christ.</p>

<h3>The Christian Faith and Modern Science</h3>


<p>A discussion of the present relations
between science and the Christian Faith
must be very largely a discussion of the
theory of evolution. Our age has been called
evolution-mad; we can scarcely speak or even
think except in biological terms and under biological
categories. The evolution theory has influenced
every department of thought and even
the science of thought itself, and it is often assumed
that everything pre-Darwinian must be
thrown to the intellectual scrap-heap.</p>

<p>Half a century ago the time was ripe for a new
generalization in science which should include
the organic world. Newton had extended the
reign of mechanism in space, and Lyell, by substituting
the uniformitarian for the catastrophic
theory of the formation of the earth's crust,
had effected the same extension in time. Men's
minds had become familiar with the thought of
immense reaches of space and of vast periods of
time, and with the idea in both spheres of the
reign of natural law instead of immediate divine
intervention. The Darwinian hypothesis of Natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Selection came as the culmination of this
movement of a progressive substitution of a natural
for a supernatural explanation of things.
The motions of planets and heavenly bodies, the
formation of the strata of the earth's crust, and
now the kingdom of organic life were brought
within the domain of natural and general law.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to describe in detail the
ferment in religious thought which followed the
publication of the "Origin of Species," 1859; but
we may notice briefly the extreme inferences
which were drawn unfavourable to religion, and
then the inevitable reaction. On the one hand
there were loud claims at first that the death-knell
of religion had been sounded. A cause
other than creation had been discovered for the
origin of species and by analogy for other origins
formerly assigned to the Creator. Chance, not
only blind but apparently cruel, was enthroned
in the place of design in the production of the
various forms of life. The higher was evolved
from the lower, but in a way that gave to the
higher the quality of the lower. Man was no
longer the child of God, not even the prodigal
child. He was the progeny of the brute and
shared his destiny. The obligation to be moral,
or even decent, had no higher sanction than the
fierce struggle for existence. Theism was derived
from animal-or ancestor-worship, and had
no higher authority or credibility. Man, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
longer made in the divine image, could lay no
claim to a divine inheritance; not fallen, but
rising out of his brute inheritance, he had no
need for the divine mercy.</p>

<p>Renan in France, Haeckel in Germany, and
Grant Allen in England agreed that religion was
doomed.<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Religious beliefs, according to the
last named, were destined "to be entirely discredited
as grotesque, fungoid growths which
had clustered around the thread of primitive
ancestor-worship." Renan inferred as one result
of Darwinism the gradual dying out of religion;
while the fundamental postulates of religion, God,
Freedom and Immortality, were, according to
Haeckel, all given the <i>coup de grace</i>. The life of
man, entangled by descent with lower orders of
being, seemed divorced from the wisdom and
purpose of God, and an all-engulfing mechanism
threatened to swallow up the hopes and aspirations
of mankind. The situation illustrated the
statement of Emerson: "The very hopes of
man, the thoughts of his heart, the religion of
nations, the manners and morals of mankind, are
all at the mercy of a new generalization."</p>

<p>From this extreme position there was an
inevitable reaction. Evolution was seen to
present a face not so unfavourable to religion.
Origin and destiny were two questions; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
higher might be evolved from the lower, but not
in such a way as to deprive the higher of its
proper quality. If nature and man were so
closely related, our idea of the worth of nature
could be exalted without depriving man of his
dignity. "A man's a man for a' that," whether
sprung from the dust of the earth, as had been
always held, or derived from organic material
below him. An orthodox evolutionist developed
a new and powerful argument for immortality; if
man had gone so far, why not farther? The
meaning of the whole evolutionary process, of the
long travail of nature, was obviously, if it had a
meaning (and why deny this to our intellectual
confusion?), the production of man with his endowments,
aspirations and hopes. Descent may
become ascent, and the meaning of evolution
may well be the development of freedom, and
immortality but evolution at the end of its journey.
A new and grander teleology was discernible
in nature, not seen in the details of its products
so much as in the great tendencies and lines of
its development and the outworking of its laws.
Most impressive of all, it was found that devout
Christians, like Charles Kingsley, could become
evolutionists without losing their faith; and that
evolutionists like Romanes (who had spoken,
during his eclipse of faith, of the evolutionary
theory as a deluge, "uprooting our most cherished
hopes, engulfing our most precious creed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
burying our highest life in mindless destruction"<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>)
could become Christians, or regain their faith,
without affecting their scientific views.</p>

<p>With all the problems which evolution has set
for religious thought, it should be noticed that it
has distinctly relieved the pressure of one difficulty
which has been felt, though now much less
acutely than formerly, since the time of Copernicus.
In the words of Aubrey De Vere:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This sphere is not God's ocean, but one drop<br></span>
<span class="i0">Showered from its spray. Came God from heaven for that?<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Life, and life upon the earth, is the centre of
attention in the thought of the day. With the
physicist who sees the promise and potency of all
terrestrial life in the primitive star-dust, with the
biologist who speaks of the fitness of the environment
to sustain life, or with the philosopher who
sees in the vital impulse the most important
thing in the history of the universe, the viewpoint
is necessarily biocentric. Yet it has been
pointed out that the sum of organized matter "is
but an atom in the mass of the solar system, it
occupies but a moment in its duration; it has
hardly a place in space; it is but a temporary
film on one of the smaller planets. It can exist
only in a very small part of the scale of temperatures
through which the spheres pass from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
first to their last state. Set against the visible
universe it is as near to nothing as we can well
conceive anything to be."<a name="FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> A distinguished
evolutionist has developed an argument to prove
that the earth alone in the solar system or elsewhere
fulfills the conditions of the existence of
any high form of life.<a name="FNanchor_4_54" id="FNanchor_4_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It is not necessary to
estimate the value of Wallace's argument in order
to emphasize, from an evolutionary point of view,
the importance of life and of man in the universe.
If the standpoint of science to-day is frankly
biocentric, in spite of the insignificant bulk of
organized matter, religious thought need not be
accused of provincialism because it is anthropocentric
in its interest.</p>

<p>In studying a little more closely the religious
bearings of evolution, it will be convenient to
notice, I. The Method of Evolution, or the biological
discussion; II. The Meaning of Evolution,
or the philosophical discussion; and
III. Theism and Evolution, or the more directly
religious aspects of the theory.</p>
<br>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Method of Evolution</span></p>

<p>While there is general agreement among biologists
that species have been derived from one
another by natural causes, there is a wide diversity
of opinion as to the method by which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
result has been brought about. Darwin's theory
of natural selection has a struggle for existence of
its own, a fight for life with other evolutionary
theories. Emphatic protests are made from the
side of experimental biology (de Vries), of
paleontology (Osborn), and of philosophical
evolution (Bergson) against the Darwinian
hypothesis that the selection of minute fortuitous
variations can account for the rise of new species
or explain the great lines of development. It is
only necessary to read the two volumes published
in England and America<a name="FNanchor_5_55" id="FNanchor_5_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> in honour of the hundredth
anniversary of Darwin's birth and the
fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the
"Origin of Species" to see that scientific opinion
upon the question of the method of evolution is
widely divided.</p>

<p>In Biblical language, the question of the hour
in biology is, Who (or what) made thee to differ?
"It is the question," in the words of C. H. Eigenmann,
"of how the straight line of exact hereditary
repetition may be caused to swerve in a definite
direction to reach an adaptive point. This is the
question of the present generation, perhaps of the
entire twentieth century."<a name="FNanchor_6_56" id="FNanchor_6_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The Newton of biology, who will discover the
laws of variation and heredity, has not, it is safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to say, yet appeared. Variation in a definite
direction in virtue of an internal tendency in the
organism (Nägeli); variation in response to the
specific stimulus of the environment (Eimer);
variation due, at least in animals, to the conscious
effort of the individual (Lamarck); variation inciting
a corresponding strengthening of parts
of the individual organism, until time should
be given for hereditary strengthening of these
parts (organic selection as taught by Baldwin,
Osborn and Lloyd Morgan); variation due to the
preservation and accumulation of minute fluctuations
by natural selection (Darwinism in its usual
form); variation from unknown causes suddenly
and discontinuously (the mutationism of de Vries);
variation due to a mystical vital impulse in organic
life as a whole (the creative evolution of
Bergson):&mdash;no one of these views, if we take
scientific opinion as a whole, can be said to have
torn aside the veil behind which nature carries on
her creative works.</p>

<p>The most notable attempt to supplement and
strengthen the theory of natural selection has
been made by Weismann in his theory of Germinal
Selection. In Weismann's hypothesis,
which has furnished in a sense the philosophical
basis for the popular Eugenics movement, the
struggle for existence is transferred to a struggle
among the constituents of the germ-plasm. The
minute invisible "determinants" of the germ-plasm,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
which give rise to the variations in the
organ, or cell, which they determine, are unequally
nourished by the nutritive stream. A determinant
at first favoured by chance may at
length gain strength actively to nourish itself to
the detriment of its fellow-determinants, and thus
attain a permanent upward movement. With
Weismann the fluctuations within the germ-plasm
"are the real root of all hereditary variations,
and the preliminary condition for the occurrence
of the Darwin-Wallace factor of selection." The
struggle for existence, or the struggle for possession
of the mate in sexual selection, practically
goes back to "the struggle between the determinants
within the germ-plasm"<a name="FNanchor_7_57" id="FNanchor_7_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for food and space.</p>

<p>Let us see how this theory of determinants will
apply to the famous case of the antlers of the elk
or stag. The antlers would increase in size, in
this case, only because the determinants, corresponding
in the germ-plasm to the antlers in the
adult organism, attracted nourishment to themselves,
and withdrew it to a certain extent from
their fellows. Instead, therefore, of a corresponding
strengthening in the whole anterior half of
the animal, which Weismann admits would be
necessary,<a name="FNanchor_8_58" id="FNanchor_8_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> we should have, with the increased
weight of the antlers, a decrease in weight and
strength of other parts of the body. The problem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
instead of being solved, seems to be involved
in deeper mystery, and there will be hesitation in
accepting the statement that "thus in our time
the great riddle has been solved&mdash;the riddle of
the origin of what is suited to its purpose without
the coöperation of purposive forces."<a name="FNanchor_9_59" id="FNanchor_9_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> T. H.
Morgan thinks it unfortunate that Weismann
should seek to supply the deficiencies of Darwin's
theory by new speculative matter skilfully
removed from the field of verification.<a name="FNanchor_10_60" id="FNanchor_10_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Biologists are generally agreed in holding the
doctrine of "descent with modifications," but
there is no agreement as to the method by which
variations in species are brought about. Bateson
even declares that "evolutionary orthodoxy developed
too fast," and that "the time is not ripe
for the discussion of the origin of species."<a name="FNanchor_11_61" id="FNanchor_11_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
S. Herbert concludes: "In short, while natural
selection can be looked upon as the efficient cause
of the progress of evolutionary lines, their first
beginnings must still be attributed to a still 'unknown
factor in evolution.'"<a name="FNanchor_12_62" id="FNanchor_12_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The neo-Darwinian who sees in the accumulation
of minute chance variations a sufficient explanation
of the origin of species, cannot be said
to hold the field in such a way as to call for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
unquestioning acceptance of his views by the lay
public; far less need the more remote philosophical
inferences sometimes drawn from his
premises be accepted without challenge as the
teaching of science. While the central mystery,
in the opinion of leading biologists, remains unsolved
in the biological field, evolution or natural
selection should be used with caution as the solvent
of all the problems of the universe. The masterkey
should first unlock the doors nearer home.</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Meaning of Evolution</span></p>

<p>The more philosophical discussion of the
Meaning of Evolution includes in its scope the
questions of mechanism and design and of
preformation and epigenesis.</p>

<p>1. Is the doctrine of evolution a foe to design,
or does evolution make more teleology than it
destroys? Let us assume for the present the neo-Darwinian
position, and ask whether design can
be excluded, first from the organic world without
man, and then from the organic world including
man. The whole system of things so ordered
that through the operation of the laws of variability,
struggle for existence, inheritance, elimination
and selection, there should be worked out
the myriad forms of life in ever increasing complexity,
calls more loudly for the postulate of intelligence
than do the special contrivances and
adaptations in nature when viewed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
standpoint of their separate origin. If Paley's
watch calls for a watchmaker, a system or arrangement
of nature which has been likened, not
to a simple watch, but rather to a watch (or a sundial)
which makes all other watches, and these
watches of a constantly improved quality and increased
complexity, cannot permanently be regarded
in any other than a teleological light. If
the whole process should prove to be mechanical,
the evidence for design is seen even more strikingly
in the complex machinery itself than in the
product.</p>

<p>Huxley says that "there is a wider teleology
which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution,
but is actually based upon the fundamental
proposition of evolution."<a name="FNanchor_13_63" id="FNanchor_13_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> When A. R. Wallace
at first argued that many of the characteristic
human qualities were not due to natural selection,
because of no value in the struggle for existence,<a name="FNanchor_14_64" id="FNanchor_14_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
his view incurred the ridicule of his
critics, who interpreted it to mean that "our
brains are made by God and our lungs by natural
selection." After forty years of reflection,
Wallace now takes a broader view of the place
of purpose in evolution, and says: "I now uphold
the doctrine that not man alone, but the
whole World of Life, in almost all its varied
manifestations, leads us to the same conclusion&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to afford any rational explanation of its
phenomena, we require to postulate the continuous
action and guidance of higher intelligences;
and further, that these have probably been working
towards a single end, the development of
intellectual, moral, and spiritual beings."<a name="FNanchor_15_65" id="FNanchor_15_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> A
distinguished biologist has said that "to believe
that all the countless myriads of centres of
coöperation and coördination which have been
required for this cosmos could have been originated
and maintained by unintelligent force acting
fortuitously makes an immensely greater
strain upon faith than the alternative hypothesis."<a name="FNanchor_16_66" id="FNanchor_16_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The teleological argument has shown of late
unusual vitality, and its renewed support has
come, singularly enough, from the evolutionary
quarter. Thus L. J. Henderson, inquiring into
the biological significance of the properties of
matter, concludes that "the process of cosmic
(inorganic) evolution is indissolubly linked with
the fundamental characteristics of the organism;
that logically, in some obscure manner, cosmic
and biological evolution are one."<a name="FNanchor_17_67" id="FNanchor_17_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The biologist,
he thinks, "may now rightly regard the universe
in its very essence as biocentric."<a name="FNanchor_18_68" id="FNanchor_18_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Wallace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in his "World of Life," draws the inference
which Henderson suggests but, as a scientist,
feels that he cannot adopt: "The remote but
more fundamental cause [of the living world],
which has been comparatively little attended to,
is the existence of a special group of elements
possessing such exceptional and altogether extraordinary
properties as to render <i>possible</i> the
existence of vegetable and animal life-forms."
These elements are like the fuel, iron and water
in a steam-engine. "We may presume that the
Mind which first caused these elements to exist,
and built them up into such marvellous living,
moving, self-supporting, and self-reproducing
structures, must be many million times greater
than those which conceived and executed the
modern steam-engine."<a name="FNanchor_19_69" id="FNanchor_19_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear, then, that biological evolution
at all necessitates the acceptance of a mechanical
view of the universe from which the action
of purpose is excluded. Protests against such a
view have, in fact, been coming of late from the
scientific philosophers and the philosophical
scientists. Bergson, a type of the former, insists
that spontaneity, movement, indeterminateness
are the differentia of life. Among the scientists,
Ostwald thinks that an absolutely determined
world is not the real world, but an ideal world;<a name="FNanchor_20_70" id="FNanchor_20_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and Sir O. Lodge speaks of the theory that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
everything in the world is mechanically determined
as a "modern superstition."<a name="FNanchor_21_71" id="FNanchor_21_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> How is
the southward flight of the bird and its return in
the spring to its own nest, or the journey of an
eel thousands of miles up an inland river and its
return thence to spawn in the deep waters of the
ocean, to be explained as the result of purely
mechanical causes? Driesch insists that the
chemical-physical processes "do not constitute
life, they are <i>used</i> by life."<a name="FNanchor_22_72" id="FNanchor_22_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The mechanical interpretation of things, however
useful for some purposes it may be, appears
increasingly thin and ghostly as we advance
into the realms of life, consciousness and freedom.
It becomes a caricature of reality. It is not
merely a colourless photograph as over against a
portrait&mdash;everything reduced to black and white;
but it is like an X-ray photograph of a living
man, a mere skeleton without flesh and blood.
Mechanism is independent of time, but time is,
in a sense, of the essence of the organism. The
mechanical movement can be reversed, while life
processes are irreversible.</p>

<p>The life and career of a great scientist such as
Pasteur, it has been said, is a more impressive
evidence of design than any adduced by Paley
and the Bridgwater treatises.<a name="FNanchor_23_73" id="FNanchor_23_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Man has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
called "Nature's rebel," and the endowments of
man and his achievements in controlling nature
and understanding nature are a disturbing element
in any theory which would exclude the
operation of intelligence from the course of evolution.
Romanes tells us: "When I wrote the preceding
treatise ["The Candid Examination"],
I did not sufficiently appreciate the immense
importance of <i>human</i> nature, as distinguished
from physical nature, in an inquiry touching
Theism."<a name="FNanchor_24_74" id="FNanchor_24_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The drama of evolution as unfolded by science
inevitably suggests that in the fortunes and life
of humanity is to be heard the <i>motif</i> of nature's
music, unless indeed all is chaos and discord.
The diapason ends full in man, or rather begins
in man and the history of his life upon the earth.
It may still be believed&mdash;because of evolution
avowedly, or in spite of evolution&mdash;that man is
a happy or an unhappy accident, a sport, a
monstrosity, the miscarriage of an ape, a <i>faux
pas</i> of nature, the strangest event in a purposeless
series; or man may be regarded, with much
to support such an interpretation, as the intended
goal of evolution, giving significance, rationality
and purpose to the whole history. However
slow and gradual the steps by which man has
been produced, and however mechanical in one
aspect the process, it may be insisted that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
mechanism so perfect as to produce the varied
forms of organic life, culminating in man, with
his mental and moral endowments, is as strong
evidence as could be produced of purpose as the
ultimate and only explanation of the mechanism.</p>

<p>Certainly the difficulty of evolving the fit
from the fortuitous becomes accentuated when
man is included within the series. Man, a purposive
and moral being, sees in himself and the
structure of his mind and the experience of his
life the crowning evidence of the action of purpose.
If the cause must be adequate to produce
the effect, man cannot regard himself as the
product of an accidental or mechanical process
from whose inception and operation the action
of intelligence is excluded. In a word, a purposive
being cannot have been the result of a
purposeless process.</p>

<p>It is significant that those who have interpreted
evolution to the masses have quite uniformly
done so in terms of progress. But progress is a
teleological conception. In a world where atoms
shift unceasingly, but without the guidance of
intelligence or will, there may be change but
there will be no progress; for one arrangement
of atoms will be as high in the scale of values as
another. Evolutionists who, as evolutionists, are
inspired with an ideal of human progress must
in some sense be finalists. If the history of the
world and of man presents any real progress, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
can only be because it is in so far an expression
of purpose.</p>

<p>2. It is an example of what Cardinal Newman
called the development of doctrine that the theory
of Evolution has come to mean, in popular regard,
quite the opposite of what it meant etymologically
or in the mind of its early advocates.
Evolution means the unfolding of what was
enfolded, either in primordial living germs or,
to go still further back, in the primitive star-dust.
Whatever is in the product must be read back
into the elements from which it emerged, and a
complete knowledge of these elements and their
properties would thus disclose potencies for the
production, under suitable conditions, of the
completed development.</p>

<p>A glance, almost at random, at current literature
in which the conception of evolution is
employed in philosophical and theological discussion,
shows that the theory has suffered a
sea-change. It has now come to mean, to many
who use it freely, not the unfolding of the implicit,
but the production or appearance of something
essentially new, a creative synthesis or
epigenesis. Bergson, James Ward, Baron von
Hügel and Loisy are among those who use the
term in this sense. Thus the last named writer
says: "That which constitutes man as a human
being is that which he possesses more
than the beasts, and not that which he possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in common with them. From the fact that
humanity proceeds from animality, it does not
follow that it is explained and defined altogether
by animality, otherwise evolution must
be denied."<a name="FNanchor_25_75" id="FNanchor_25_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>This modification of meaning is important
when the doctrine of evolution is extended downward
into the inorganic sphere. Since species
are derived from one another, it used to be argued,
life must be derived from the lifeless; and
it is obvious that if this process is pursued it will
lead to an infinite regress. We go back from
the civilized to the savage, from the conscious
to the unconscious, from the organic to the
inorganic, till finally the evolution of the atom
becomes the problem of problems. We go back
in an infinite regress, approaching the ideal limit:
In the beginning, nothing. The goal would seem
to be the evolution of primitive matter out of
nothing, as Alfred Noyes has suggested in his
poem, "The Origin of Life":</p>

</div></div>

<p>The principle of continuity urges the evolutionist
to extend his theory downward into the
inorganic world and upward into the sphere of
the moral and the spiritual. At the crucial points
of the origin of life and of the human race, the
advocate of preformation has greater difficulty
than the supporter of epigenesis or creative evolution,
which is a sort of <i>rapprochement</i> between
evolutionism and creationism. Let us see how
the case stands at present as regards the origin
of life and the origin of man.</p>

<p>Life may be generated any day in the laboratory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
but as yet this has not been done.<a name="FNanchor_26_76" id="FNanchor_26_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In fact
so great are the difficulties that Arrhenius thinks
that there was no beginning of life, life being
eternal and persisting, in spite of acknowledged
scientific difficulties in the conception, amid the
vicissitudes of cosmic changes and flights through
interstellar space.<a name="FNanchor_27_77" id="FNanchor_27_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Weismann does not think
that a living germ could be conveyed in the
crevices of meteorites to our planet, because "it
could neither endure the excessive cold nor the
absolute desiccation to which it would be exposed
in cosmic space, which contains absolutely no
water. This could not be endured even for a
few days, much less for immeasurable periods of
time."<a name="FNanchor_28_78" id="FNanchor_28_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Lord Kelvin will not go as far as Arrhenius,
but believes that a meteorite brought the first
living germs to this planet. K. Pearson thinks
that under favourable conditions in the remote
past life arose, but arose only once, out of the
non-living.<a name="FNanchor_29_79" id="FNanchor_29_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The bridge was so slender that it
was crossed but once under imaginary conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
not controllable by experiment; and as a
unique event even in imaginary history it cannot
be said to be subject to any general law. It is
questionable, in fact, whether in scientific merit
the hypothesis is superior to that of special
creation.</p>

<p>Dr. Schäfer sees this and points it out very
clearly in his Presidential Address.<a name="FNanchor_30_80" id="FNanchor_30_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> A scientific
account of the origin of life must refer it to causes
operating to-day; so, instead of Arrhenius' eternity
of life, or of Pearson's spontaneous production
of life but once under inaccessible conditions,
or Lord Kelvin's meteoric conveyance of life, he
believes that life is constantly being produced,
and has always been produced, from certain colloidal
substances which he describes. But what
has become of all this life, constantly generated?
He admits there is trace of only one paleontological
series. While assuming that it is the
nature of life to evolve, he admits that there is
no evidence accessible to the senses or discerned
as yet by the most delicate instruments for the
existence of these countless beginnings of life.
The real question then concerns not this kind of
life, which eye hath not seen, but the origin of
the life which we know, and whose marvellous
development evolution traces. Ostwald thinks
that "it is undecided whether originally there
were one or several forms from which the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
forms sprang, nor is it known how life first
made its appearance on earth. So long as the
various assumptions with regard to this question
have not led to decisive, actually demonstrable
differences in the results, a discussion of it is
fruitless, and therefore unscientific."<a name="FNanchor_31_81" id="FNanchor_31_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A comparison has often been drawn between
the birth of the individual and that of the race.
Theologians have discussed the question whether
the child in his spiritual nature is to be referred
to a special act of creative power, or whether
all of his endowments are derived from his
parents.</p>

<p>To the poet the birth of the child suggests the
presence of forces other than those of the seen
and temporal. The new life is "out of the deep,
from the true world, within the world we see." Its
roots are in another dimension of being than that
of nature or the world of time and sense. In
moments of insight, "though inland far we be,
our souls have sight of that immortal sea which
brought us hither."</p>

<p>Again to the philosopher there is in the individual
something indescribable, unique, not to be
compressed within the compass of any general
law, something in each individual which his ancestry
or antecedents will not explain nor his
environment produce.<a name="FNanchor_32_82" id="FNanchor_32_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

<p>Says a distinguished professor of biology<a name="FNanchor_33_83" id="FNanchor_33_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>:
"Familiarity with development does not remove
the real mystery which lies back of it. The development
of a human being, of a personality,
from a germ cell seems to me the climax of all
wonders, greater even than that involved in the
evolution of a species or the making of a world."
He remarks that "if personality is determined by
heredity alone, all teaching, preaching, government,
is useless." The only hope for the race,
he says, is in eugenics&mdash;always supposing that
enough freedom is left to carry out its program.</p>

<p>If the birth of the individual and the full story
of his origin is thus enveloped in mystery for
theologian, poet, philosopher and even scientist,
it is not to be expected that the problem of the
origin of the human race can be solved by a neat
formula. Here the mystery of the birth of the
individual from parents of the same species is
intensified many fold. Here the problems of
mind and body, of their genetic and metaphysical
relations to each other, and of the ultimate relation
of the spirit world to each, press for solution
before there can be any full and final answer to
the question of the origin of man. Is it any
wonder that the single occurrence upon which
was based the birth of all future generations
which have peopled the earth should be thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to involve more than can be included in any
scientific hypothesis?<a name="FNanchor_34_84" id="FNanchor_34_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>When we seek to interpret these critical points
in the history of the world, such as the origin of
life and of man, two roads are open before us.
We may emphasize, with the advocates of preformation,
the principle of continuity alone; and,
explaining the higher by the lower, we may go
back as Mr. Noyes would carry us, back on the
dwindling track, explaining civilization by
savagery, the non-moral by the moral, the conscious
by the unconscious, the living by the non-living.
In this process, it has been often pointed
out, there lurks a sort of <i>generatio æquivoca</i>;
primitive star-dust is endowed with the attributes
of life, of consciousness, and even of purpose and
morality. Thus J. A. Thomson says that "if we
see any good reason for believing in the erstwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
origin of the living from the not-living, we
give a greater continuity to the course of events,
and we must again read something into the common
denominator of science&mdash;Matter, Energy,
and the Ether. We have already read into this
Wonder and Mystery, Harmony and Order, and
we must now read into it&mdash;Progress and, from a
philosophical standpoint, Purpose."<a name="FNanchor_36_85" id="FNanchor_36_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The objection will be made that to regard the
primitive atoms or cells as practically self-preserving,
self-repairing and self-improving, the fountain
of all life, of all consciousness and morality
and civilization, is to endow these entities with
attributes that are manifestly inappropriate.</p>

<p>Seeing the difficulties of a theory of evolution
based upon the principle of continuity alone, we
may emphasize, with many popular interpreters,
not so much this principle of continuity, as that
of progress. Evolution would then mean not a
mere shifting of the elements, a redistribution of
matter and motion, but a creative synthesis, an
epigenesis. It will then mean, not "There is
nothing new under the sun," but rather, "What
next?" The descent of man will no longer suggest
the inference that as the progeny of the brute
man must share his destiny, but rather the
thought that "it doth not yet appear what we
shall be."</p>

<p>But how to explain the new element which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
arisen, not out of, but alongside of, the others?
We would not be content to say, "Now the inorganic
elements incapable of producing life; and
now, presto! living matter;" for this after all
would be a break in continuity not explained,
and would lead once more to a sort of creation
<i>ex nihilo</i>. The necessities of the case seem to
call for some new conception which shall unite
the two great principles of continuity and progress.</p>

<br>
<p>III. <span class="smcap">Theism and Evolution</span></p>

<p>We have reached the point where it can be
seen that evolution, when elevated from a biological
hypothesis into a theory of the universe,
is in need of the theistic postulate in order to
make it workable. Theism, in fact, offers a twofold
advantage to the evolution theory. It satisfies
the causal demand, and it furnishes the means
of combining the two ideas of continuity and
progress which have impressed themselves so
deeply upon the mind of our generation.</p>

<p>In the first place it satisfies the causal demand.
If evolution is but the unfolding of the
implicit, as the preformation view would have it,
an explanation is naturally sought for the marvellous
properties of the original star-dust, or mind-stuff,
or the primordial living germ. The more
mechanical the interpretation of the course of
things becomes, the more insistent, again, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the questions, Who made the mechanism? Who
drives the mechanism? Even from the standpoint
of epigenesis, the appearance of an entirely
new element, which by hypothesis is not
merely implicit in the previous state of things,
must be referred to some adequate cause or
ground. Evolution, in any of its forms, is the
name of a method rather than of a cause; and
"logic compels the evolutionist to assume a
force that was not evolved, but which existed before
evolution began."<a name="FNanchor_37_86" id="FNanchor_37_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>If we interpret the power behind evolution in
a theistic sense, and believe that God is immanent
in nature and in the life of man, we are not
absolved from the task of tracing as far as possible
the natural history of life and mind, but we
may view that history from a standpoint from
which both origin and progressive development
become intelligible. No scientific hypothesis is
able in itself to carry us all the way from "concentrating
nebulæ to the thoughts of poets." A
theory of the universe which shall do justice to
the conceptions both of continuity and progress
can best be framed with the aid of the category
of purpose.</p>

<p>The continuity is preserved in the unity of the
developing plan, no stage of which is sudden or
abrupt, but is related "filially" to the stage and
the stages which preceded. The relation between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
two stages is not like that between the
two members of an equation, a relation of exact
equivalence between the evolved and the involved.
There is a really new element in the
later stage if there is a real progress. But the
new factor comes not in dramatic or spectacular
fashion; it comes without observation, and comes
not to destroy but to fulfill.</p>

<p>If the evolution theory is to cover the whole
history of the world and of man, it must be hospitable
to the ideas both of continuity and progress.
An interpretation of evolution so framed
would be opposed, indeed, to the conception of
a Creator touching the world only with His
finger-tips, and exhausting His creative power
in its initial exercise. It would be opposed to
materialistic monism, as well as to an idealistic
or pantheistic monism which would reduce the
evolutionary and historic process to mere appearance.
Evolution in its theistic construction
sees in the lower orders of existence and in the
earlier stages of life the promise, but not the
potency, of the higher. It assumes the existence
of a power immanent in the universe and
adequate to account for the appearance of new
forces. It can interpret alike the continuity of
the evolutionary process, and the appearance
once for all in the irreversible moments of progress
of new forms and forces of life. It admits
the possibility of the appearance of new spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
forces in the course of history, and opens a vista
of illimitable progress.</p>

<p>No one was more certain than Huxley, when
speaking of the relation of man to the lower
animals, that "whether <i>from</i> them or not, he is
assuredly not <i>of</i> them."<a name="FNanchor_38_87" id="FNanchor_38_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Man's peculiar endowments,
his sense of law and beauty, his
spiritual capacities and aspirations, all of these,
if laws of analogy and causation are to hold,
point to a different dimension of being from
that of nature below him. If "man still bears
in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his
lowly origin,"<a name="FNanchor_39_88" id="FNanchor_39_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> he bears in the framework of
his mind and moral nature the indelible stamp
of his spiritual origin. His spiritual endowments
can find their explanation only in a spiritual
world. They have arisen, not from the lair of
the wild beast, but rather from the bosom of
God. No ascertained fact of science, nor any
legitimate or necessary inference from any such
fact, forbids the affirmation of faith, "It is He
that hath made us," and "we are His people."</p>

<p>With each advance of science the thoughts of
men are disturbed. The discoveries of Copernicus
and Galileo seemed to destroy the foundations
of the Christian, or even the theistic, view
of the world; but the astronomer to-day can see
anew God's glory in the heavens and more impressive
evidence of His greatness and majesty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
When Newton's laws of motion displaced the
idea that the planets were conveyed about their
orbits by angelic beings, it was feared that atheism
was the logical inference. But Newton himself
remained a devout theist, and even Voltaire,
his admirer, was ready</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To follow Newton in that boundless road,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where nature's lost, and ev'rything but God."<br></span></div>
</div>

<p>So when evolution, through the genius of Darwin,
came into popular discussion and acceptance,
it was feared that chance had been enthroned
in the universe, and that religion was
destined to extinction. But in the progress of
the evolution theory, as its advocates have split
into various camps, the sense of the mystery in
the origins and laws of the organic world has
deepened, and many can see in nature the evidence
of a diviner wisdom than before.</p>

<p>Dr. Schäfer in his presidential address before
the British Association, in 1912, spoke in one
sense of the continuity of life, giving to it what
seemed like a mechanical or materialistic interpretation.
The following presidential address,
by Sir Oliver Lodge, spoke of the continuity of
life in another sense, a continuation of life after
death; and argued that mechanism is inadequate
to explain the facts of life, and asserted that
"genuine religion has its roots deep down in the
heart of humanity, and in the reality of things."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
At each stage of advance in science, says a
recent writer, "this joyful overestimate of the
possibilities of mechanism becomes a marked
feature of contemporary thought. As each piece
of knowledge becomes assimilated, it is seen that
the old problems are in their essence unaltered;
the poet, the seer and the mystic again come to
their own, and, in new language, and from a
higher ground of vantage, proclaim their message
to mankind."<a name="FNanchor_40_89" id="FNanchor_40_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The horizons of mystery are not at the confines
of telescopic vision, or at the far boundaries of
the material universe, but are in the objects
which are most familiar, in the meanest flower
that blows, in the minutest seed and in the
smallest atom. As the poet finds in the flower
thoughts too deep for tears, so the scientist sees
in it problems too vast and far-reaching for
human comprehension. He can see in the very
atom minute solar systems, and in electricity a
mystery lying at the very heart of material
things.</p>

<p>It is the paradox of science that the more the
world is understood, the deeper does the mystery
of its existence become. With the enlarging
boundaries of knowledge there is a growing appreciation
of mysteries perhaps insoluble which
lie beyond. Science, in fact, only deals with the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
connections of things, and the processes by
which they came to be what they are, but not
with the ultimate origins and the final ends.
The deeper study of nature will lead men, we
may believe, in the future as it has done in the
past, to the reverent attitude of a Kepler, a
Newton, a Clerk-Maxwell, and a Lord Kelvin.
They will see in the bird's feather and the butterfly's
wing, in the constitution of the cell and the
atom, in the stellar universe and the mind of
man, evidences of creative Power and Purpose;
and, turning from the study of nature, will exclaim,
"How wonderful are Thy works; in
wisdom hast Thou made them all!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>The Christian Faith and Psychology</h3>


<p>The Psychology of Religion as a branch
of scientific study was "made in America,"
and is not yet twenty years old.
Its virtual founder and popularizer was William
James, who furnished the introduction to Starbuck's
"Psychology of Religion" (1900) and published
his "Varieties of Religious Experience,"
the quarry in which all subsequent writers have
mined, in 1903. An earlier American philosopher,
Jonathan Edwards, gained the right to be
called the precursor of the science by his treatise
on the Religious Emotions. Of Edwards, named
with Emerson and James as one of three representative
American philosophers, Royce has said
that "he actually rediscovered some of the
world's profoundest ideas regarding God and
humanity simply by reading for himself the
meaning of his own religious experiences."<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The way for a scientific study of religious experience
had been prepared by the development
of modern psychology and by the growing
popular interest in religious phenomena. We
recall the wide-spread interest in Drummond's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
"Natural Law in the Spiritual World," dealing
with personal religion, and in Kidd's "Social
Evolution," which dealt with the place of religion
on the broader field of human progress. The
popularity of monographs on mysticism, such as
those by W. R. Inge and Miss A. Underhill, and
of lives of the saints, such as Paul Sabatier's
"Life of Francis of Assisi" and McCabe's "Life
of Augustine," showed by the personality of their
authors and the wide circle of their readers that
religious experiences, especially if they be profound
and unusual, are matters of deep human
interest even to those not closely connected with
the churches. The saints have been taken from
the church historians, and made to live before us
as men of like passions with ourselves. For many
months recently a religious novel, "The Inside
of the Cup," held its place as the "best seller."</p>

<p>Since the pioneer work of Starbuck, Coe<a name="FNanchor_2_91" id="FNanchor_2_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and
James, the literature of the subject, largely by
American writers, has grown apace. Established
in the college course, the psychology of religion
has threatened to disturb vested rights even in
the theological schools. Conversion and sanctification,
once regarded as themes for the theological
cloister, the revival service or the closet
of devotion, have become familiar topics of the
text-books and commonplaces of the lecture
room.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>

<p>Will this study of religion from the psychological
standpoint prove to be an ally to the
Christian Faith, or will it put new weapons into
the hands of its enemies? It may be too early
for a positive answer, but the advertising value
of the new movement cannot be denied, and
several specific entries at least may be made on
the credit side of the ledger. The materials for
religious psychology have been drawn mainly
from Christian biography and Christian experience.
Impressive stories of conversion, gathered
from the ages of Christendom and from the work
of city and foreign missions, have strengthened
the argument from Christian experience. Taken
from religious biographies and devotional books
and missionary annals and modern questionnaires,
the testimony of the saints of all ages has
been marshalled as they have told what the Lord
has done for their souls. The very fact that it
has been worth while to write psychologies of
religion is in itself significant. "Christianity,"
says Eucken, "has been the first to give the soul
a history; in comparison with the interest of the
soul, it has reduced all events in the outer world
to mere incidentals, according to the words of
Jesus: 'What shall it profit a man if he gain the
whole world and lose his own soul.'"<a name="FNanchor_3_92" id="FNanchor_3_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Separating as far as possible the descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
from the metaphysical aspects of our subject, we
may consider I. The Psychology of Religious Experience;
and II. The Metaphysical Implicates of
Religious Experience. Under the first head we
shall find that the study of religious experience has
been favourable to the Christian Faith in at least
four respects.</p>
<br>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Psychology of Religious
Experience</span></p>

<p>I. The scientific study of religion shows that
religion belongs to the essence rather than the accidents
of human nature. Man is the praying,
the believing, and the hoping-to-survive animal.
It is not the office of psychology to prove the
existence of God, but it may show that belief in
His existence is natural to man, and is favoured
by natural selection. It may show that religious
experiences have, in the words of James, "enormous
biological worth,"<a name="FNanchor_4_93" id="FNanchor_4_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and that, to quote again
the same writer, "the strenuous type of character
will on the battle-field of human history always
outwear the easy-going type, and religion will
drive irreligion to the wall."<a name="FNanchor_5_94" id="FNanchor_5_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>One evidence of the normality of religious faith
is the vacuum or sense of loss which continues
to be felt in the life of those who have lost it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
we need God, as Augustine says, in order that
the soul may live, it is natural that there should
be a feeling of spiritual starvation without God.
The two classical instances of this "aching void
the world can never fill" are those of two well-known
scientists, one writing in the eclipse, apparently
permanent, of his faith, and the other
after its restoration. Says W. K. Clifford:
"Whether or no it be reasonable and satisfying
to the conscience, it cannot be doubted that theistic
belief is a comfort and a solace to those who
hold it, and that the loss of it is a very painful loss....
We have seen the spring sun shine out
of an empty heaven, to light up a soulless earth;
we have felt with utter loneliness that the Great
Companion is dead. Our children, it may be
hoped, will know that sorrow only by the reflex
light of a wondering compassion."<a name="FNanchor_6_95" id="FNanchor_6_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is a sad
consolation that children will be spared the loss,
because they have not known the joy, of religious
faith.</p>

<p>Romanes, during the eclipse of his faith, found
that success, intellectual distraction, reputation
and artistic pleasure were "all taken together and
well sweetened to taste ... but as high confectionery
to a starving man." He adds: "I take
it then as unquestionably true that this whole
negative side of the subject proves a vacuum in
the soul of man which nothing can fill save faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in God."<a name="FNanchor_7_96" id="FNanchor_7_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Such modern instances show the
normality of religion, and are an impressive commentary
upon the words of the Psalmist, "My
soul is athirst for God," and upon those of Augustine,
"Our hearts are restless until they rest
in Thee."</p>

<p>The normality of religion is further shown in
the instinctive turning of the soul to God, or to
some higher power, in times of crisis and danger.
The religious consciousness is best interrogated,
not in times of mechanical routine or worldly
preoccupation, but in those moments when we
seem to ourselves to be most religious, in moments
of clearest insight, or of deepest emotion,
or of some crisis in action. The story of one of
the survivors of the <i>Titanic</i> disaster is in point:</p>

<p>"The second thing that stands out prominently
in the emotions produced by the disaster is that
in moments of urgent need men and women turn
for help to something entirely outside themselves....
To those men standing on the top deck
with the boats all lowered, and still more when the
boats had all left, there came the realization that
human resources were exhausted and human avenues
of escape closed. With it came the appeal
to whatever consciousness each had of a Power
that had created the universe. After all, some
Power had made the brilliant stars above ...
had made each one of the passengers with ability<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
to think and act, with the best proof, after all, of
being created&mdash;knowledge of their own existence;
and now, if at any time, was the time to
appeal to that Power. When the boats had left
and it was seen the ship was going down rapidly,
men stood in groups on the deck engaged
in prayer, and later, as some of them lay on the
overturned collapsible boat, they repeated together
over and over again the Lord's Prayer....
And this was not because it was a
habit.... It must have been because each
one ... saw laid bare his utter dependence
on something that had made him and given him
power to think.... Men do practical things
in times like that: they would not waste a moment
on mere words if those words were not an
expression of the most intensely real conviction
of which they were capable. Again, like the
feeling of heroism, this appeal is innate and intuitive,
and it certainly has its foundation on a
knowledge&mdash;largely concealed, no doubt&mdash;of immortality.
I think this must be obvious: there
could be no other explanation of such a general
sinking of all the emotions of the human mind
expressed in a thousand different ways by a
thousand different people in favour of this single
appeal."<a name="FNanchor_8_97" id="FNanchor_8_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>


<p>The instinctive place and biological value of
religion in human life, the restlessness and hunger
of the soul without religion, show that it is
not an excrescence upon human nature. The
exclamation of a recent writer seems justified:
"The age of scientific materialism is past....
The religious instinct has been adjudged normal."<a name="FNanchor_9_98" id="FNanchor_9_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>2. The study of religious experience has
shown the power of religion (and certainly for
the most part its power for good) in the life of
the individual and of society. The psychologists
have thrust upon our attention with unmistakable
emphasis the <i>fact</i> of conversion, however they
may theorize about the fact. The recorded experiences
of saints, reformers and missionaries,
the testimony collected by the questionnaires and
the cases of conversion described in such books
as Begbie's "Twice-Born Men" have shown beyond
a peradventure that men <i>can</i> be born again.
It only remains for the church to say, "Ye <i>must</i>
be born again."</p>

<p>The records show that men who are the slaves
of appetite and vice, too degraded to be reached
by appeals to pride or to prudence, can by the
gospel be restored to hope and self-respect and
to lives of singular usefulness. As Begbie says:
"There is no medicine, no Act of Parliament, no
moral treatise, and no invention of philanthropy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
which can transform a man radically bad into a
man radically good.... Science despairs
of these people, pronounces them 'hopeless' and
'incurable.' Politicians find themselves at the
end of their resources. Philanthropy begins to
wonder whether its charity could not be turned
into a more fertile channel. The law speaks of
'criminal classes.' It is only religion that is
not in despair about this mass of profitless evil
dragging at the heels of progress&mdash;the religion
which still believes in miracle."<a name="FNanchor_10_99" id="FNanchor_10_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The psychologists have emphasized not only
the facts of conversion but the variety in its
mode. It has been pointed out that "conversion
for males is a more violent incident than for
females, and more sudden."<a name="FNanchor_11_100" id="FNanchor_11_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Uhlhorn has observed
that it is characteristic of a period of conflict
"that sudden conversions are more frequent
then than at other times, that the marvel inherent
in every conversion becomes more evident, and,
so to speak, more palpable."<a name="FNanchor_12_101" id="FNanchor_12_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> A child brought
up under strong religious influences will not have
the intense struggles which are natural when a
hardened criminal or a scoffing unbeliever is
converted. Count Zinzendorf raised serious misgivings
in the minds of the Moravians when he
insisted that he "could not tell the day when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
first decided for Christ, and had no knowledge
of a time when he did not love Him."<a name="FNanchor_13_102" id="FNanchor_13_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The
mother of Edmund Gosse, a woman singularly
devoted in her labours by tongue and pen to the
cause of evangelical religion, wrote in her thirtieth
year: "I cannot recollect the time I did not
love religion. If I must date my conversion
from my first wish and trial to be holy, I may go
back to infancy; if I am to postpone it till after
my last willful sin, it is scarcely yet begun."<a name="FNanchor_14_103" id="FNanchor_14_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>It would be equally one-sided to insist that all
conversions must be of the sudden or cataclysmic
type, and to ignore the tremendous significance
of some sudden and dramatic experiences of conversion.
Paul and Augustine are cases in point,
and it will scarcely do to dismiss them with the
remark that "Paul was probably a neurotic, and
that Augustine was a sensualist with a highly
developed nervous temperament."<a name="FNanchor_15_104" id="FNanchor_15_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The true
nature of conversion may best be seen, as James
suggests, in those experiences which are exaggerated
and intense.<a name="FNanchor_16_105" id="FNanchor_16_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Conversions of the sudden and dramatic type
have, as a matter of fact, exerted the most farreaching
influence in history. The secular historian
is apt nowadays to magnify the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of Paul upon the life of Europe, but the church
historian must add that Paul, as apostle or theologian
or missionary, cannot be understood apart
from the experience at Damascus. Augustine's
conversion inspired his thought and determined
his theology. Of Luther, whose conversion may
not have been of quite so dramatic a type, a
recent writer says: "Indeed, the Reformation in
Germany was the spiritual biography of Luther
writ large, a spiritual experience materialized in
institutions and intellectualized in confessions."<a name="FNanchor_17_106" id="FNanchor_17_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The psychologists unite with the historians in
describing the broad objective effects of religion
upon the field of history. Christianity in its
Pauline form presented, in the West, a successful
obstacle to the flood of Eastern thought and
culture. When the structure of the Roman Empire
was crumbling, it was Christianity in its
Roman organization that resisted the disintegrating
influences of the barbarian invasion. It
was Christianity in its Calvinistic form that became
"the seed-plot of modern democracy."
"No student of American history," says a writer
on the psychology of religion, "can fail to recognize
the immense value of religion as a factor in
our national development, keeping us in some
measure true to the ideals of our fathers....
The fact that our moral conceptions have at all
stood the strain of this rapid material development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and that political and social corruption and
decay in America to-day are not hopeless and
irremediable as they were in Rome during the
last century of the Republic, is due, I believe,
chiefly to the vitality of religion among us as a
factor effectively conservative of our socially
recognized values."<a name="FNanchor_18_107" id="FNanchor_18_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>3. At a time when the sense of sin is declining,
it is interesting to find the psychologists
pressing upon our attention the facts of the disorder,
the wrongness, the uneasiness, or frankly
the need of salvation, of human kind. It would
be out of place for the psychologist, as such, to
dogmatize upon the subject of original sin, but in
his analysis of human nature he cannot overlook
the fact of moral discord, a fact often politely
ignored in the text-books on ethics. Thus when
James speaks unreservedly and autobiographically,
he confesses that "we all need mercy."
The morally athletic attitude tends to break
down at last even in the most stalwart; and, in
the condition of moral helplessness, "all our
morality appears as a plaster hiding a sore it can
never cure, and all our well-doing as the hollowest
substitute for that well-being that our lives
ought to be grounded in, but alas! are not."<a name="FNanchor_19_108" id="FNanchor_19_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
The essential fact of religion, for Royce, is man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
quest for salvation; and the central and essential
postulate which he considers in his recent lectures,
"is the postulate that man needs to be saved."<a name="FNanchor_20_109" id="FNanchor_20_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>A distinction is sometimes drawn between a
"once-born" and a "twice-born" type of religious
experience, but the distinction is not
absolute. We have already noticed that those
who can trace no abrupt change in their experience,
nor tell the day or even the year of their
conversion, may be zealous in evangelistic labour,
and emphatic in their insistence upon the need of
regeneration. A well-known example of the
once-born type of religion is the late Edward
Everett Hale, whose words are often quoted: "I
observe, with profound regret, the religious struggles
which come into many biographies, as if almost
essential to the formation of a hero. I
ought to speak of these, to say that any man has
an advantage, not to be estimated, who is born,
as I was, into a family where the religion is
simple and rational; etc."<a name="FNanchor_21_110" id="FNanchor_21_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And yet Dr. Hale's
son, brought up in such an atmosphere, has himself
described in the public press an experience
under revival preaching which belongs to the
"twice-born" type.<a name="FNanchor_22_111" id="FNanchor_22_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The secrets of every heart are not revealed to
the psychologist, and we should not expect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
him the deepest insight into the sinfulness of sin;
but in emphasizing man's sense of need, of incompleteness,
of restlessness and of disharmony,
psychology has done much to confirm, if it cannot
of itself affirm, the Scriptural statement that
"all have sinned."</p>

<p>4. Is man saved by faith or by works, by faith
or by character? As between the evangelical
and the legal schemes of salvation, the answer of
religious psychology is emphatically in favour of
the former. Psychologists of all schools unite in
insisting that those who pass from restlessness
and impotence to peace and fullness of life do so
in wonderful accord with the Scriptural method
of salvation by faith. The witnesses may be
called, even though to a tedious degree one witness
only confirms the testimony of another.</p>

<p>We are advised by Jastrow that it is "necessary
for the life that we live that we should
frequently permit the focus of our concerns and
of our struggles to fade away, and allow the surgings
from below to assert themselves."<a name="FNanchor_23_112" id="FNanchor_23_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> James
remarks that "there is a state of mind known to
religious men, but to no others, in which the will
to assert ourselves and hold our own has been
displaced by a willingness to close our mouths
and be as nothing in the floods and waterspouts of
God.... The time for tension in our souls
is over, and that of happy relaxation, of calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
deep breathing, of an eternal present, with no discordant
future to be anxious about, has arrived."<a name="FNanchor_24_113" id="FNanchor_24_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Starbuck emphasizes the surrender of the will
in conversion even when the will has been consciously
exercised. "We are confronted with the
paradox ... that in the same persons who
strive towards the higher life, self-surrender is
often necessary before the sense of assurance
comes. The personal will must be given up.
In many cases relief persistently refuses to come
until the person ceases to resist, or to make an
effort in the direction he desires to go."<a name="FNanchor_25_114" id="FNanchor_25_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
He adds that "faith is the next step after self-surrender,
or even the accompaniment of it....
Then faith comes in, which means that
the soul is in a receptive attitude.... One
throws oneself completely on the world-will, so
that one may become a 'receiver of its truth and
an organ of its activity.'"<a name="FNanchor_26_115" id="FNanchor_26_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Royce remarks that our religious need is supreme,
and "is accompanied with the perfectly
well-warranted assurance that we cannot attain
the goal unless we can get into some sort of
communion with a real life infinitely richer than
our own.... The religious ideal grows out
of the vision of a spiritual freedom and peace
which are not naturally ours."<a name="FNanchor_27_116" id="FNanchor_27_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> "The little will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the conscious and limited individual," says
J. B. Pratt, "must simply give up before the
deeper will of the larger personality, stretching
out from the conscious centre no one knows how
far, can take control."<a name="FNanchor_28_117" id="FNanchor_28_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that the evangelical scheme of salvation,
"Heaven's easy, artless, unencumber'd
plan," has found strong and unexpected support
from the modern study of religious experience.
The impressive testimonies above, if translated
into Pauline language, mean that salvation is by
faith and not by works of the law. The examples
from which the generalizations are made are
taken mostly from orthodox circles, but even
those who are but loosely attached to Christianity
in its usual forms are saved in the same
way. Thus James says of the mind-curers that
"they have demonstrated that a form of regeneration
by relaxing, by letting go, psychologically
indistinguishable from the Lutheran justification
by faith and the Wesleyan acceptance of free
grace, is within the reach of persons who have
no conviction of sin and care nothing for the
Lutheran theology."<a name="FNanchor_29_118" id="FNanchor_29_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The theologian might
contend that Christianity is a sort of "sleeping
partner" in these schemes, and that they contain
the mustard seed of faith sufficient to save; but,
however this may be, the fact remains that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
mind-cure schemes teach a form of salvation by
faith, not by works.</p>

<p>The strain of attention and constant anxiety,
involved in the effort to keep the law and save
oneself, leads to exhaustion and despair. The
struggle is hopeless, the psychologist would say,
because the nervous centres become exhausted.
Man cannot, however zealous for the law, by
conscious activity and moral struggle attain inward
peace. Salvation by works is psychologically
as well as theologically impossible.</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Metaphysical Implicates of Religious
Experience</span></p>

<p>The students of religious experience are to a
remarkable degree in agreement with one another
and with the teachings of evangelical
Christianity in their view of the place and power
of religion in human life, and of the need of salvation
and the way of salvation. Disagreements
arise when they seek no longer to describe religious
experience but to interpret that experience.
Our authorities, in technical language,
agree very largely when they study the phenomenology
of religion, but differ widely as to its
metaphysical implicates.</p>

<p>It may properly be asked whether the psychology
of religion, while dealing with the deep
things of man, is competent to reveal the deep
things of God. Should the psychologist venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to draw any inferences in the metaphysical
sphere? Strictly speaking he is studying only
subjective phenomena, and the self-imposed limitations
of his subject should forbid him from
launching into metaphysical speculation. If he
cannot, as a psychologist, call his soul his own,
much less can he infer that God exists or that
Christianity is true. He must remain, perforce,
in the outer courts of the temple, and cannot
enter the inner shrine.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact no writer on the psychology
of religious experience really confines himself
within strictly empirical limits. Metaphysical inferences
are in fact drawn, or very plainly suggested,
and the important question becomes what
inferences of this nature, whether positive or
negative, are proper and legitimate. Religious
experience is at any rate not self-explanatory,
but points to something beyond itself, whether
that something be merely a disordered nervous
system, or a natural impulse such as that of sex,
or a department of consciousness outside of the
normal, or a Great Beyond, whether conceived as
Humanity or as the living God. We may consider
then, (1) the physical explanation of religion,
including the sexual; (2) the psychological
explanation; (3) the social explanation; and (4) the
theological explanation.</p>

<p>1. Lowest in the scale is the view of religion
which regards it as the result of abnormal physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
or psychophysical conditions. This theory
is the expression of a robust secularism, which
can quote the proverb, "When the devil was
sick, the devil a monk would be," and would
prescribe a dose of physic (as his friends did for
George Fox) for those in distress on account of
their sins. "For the modern materialist, as for
the ancient Manichee, sin is a question of physiology;
moral depravity only a manifestation of
corporeal disorder."<a name="FNanchor_30_119" id="FNanchor_30_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Religion and crime, in
this view, both depart from the line of normal
existence, and are pathological phenomena. But
if religion is a disease, it afflicts men in all sorts
of physical and mental states, and is practically
a universal disease, taking the world at large.</p>

<p>Akin to this pathological explanation of religion
is that which sees in it either a natural
expression, or else a perversion, of the sexual
instinct. "In a certain sense the religious life
is an irradiation of the reproductive instinct,"<a name="FNanchor_31_120" id="FNanchor_31_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
says Starbuck; and G. S. Hall says that "in its
most fundamental aspect, conversion is a natural,
normal, universal, and necessary process at the
stage when life pivots over from an autocentric
to a heterocentric basis."<a name="FNanchor_32_121" id="FNanchor_32_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This view is popular
with those who would give a naturalistic account
of the religious life, especially of conversion.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

<p>In assuming a close connection between human
and divine love, the mystics and the materialists
join hands. With both the sexual is transmuted
into the spiritual. Plato made the transition in
his "Phædrus," comparing divine with human
love and even with the latter in a degraded form.
The sexual passion and the passion for purity
both alike stir human nature to its depths, and
the love of God and the love of woman are somehow
akin. Religion in all ages has made free
use of the imagery of love and marriage. The
close connection has been emphasized by the
statistics which show that the period between
twelve and twenty years is preëminently the age
of conversion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the relations between the
sexual and the religious life are so various that
it does not seem possible to place them in the
simple relation of cause and effect. In ancient
religions there were examples of phallic worship
and the mutilation of priests, of temple prostitutes
and vestal virgins. Polygamy and celibacy
have both alike been enjoined in the name of religion.
The imagery of the bride and the bridegroom
has been freely used by the mystics, but
it is employed as well by those who are thought
to oppose religion.<a name="FNanchor_33_122" id="FNanchor_33_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It is true that in Christian<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>
circles the curve of conversion rises suddenly
and is at its height during the adolescent period;
but again the facts are not so clear as to warrant
the inference that conversion is an effect of the
development of the sexual life. The adolescent
period is the time also of the awakening of the
intellectual and æsthetic faculties, of the feeling
of responsibility and the stirring of ambition.
Unless all of these are irradiations of the sexual
impulse, it cannot be said that the religious
awakening, coming within this period, must be
so regarded. The adolescent period is one of
peculiar religious susceptibility, but in part this
may be due to the influence of social pressure,
brought to bear very strongly at this period by
parents and teachers. Again, the exceptions on
both sides are too many. Adolescents, even
those under religious influences, are not always
converted; indeed this period is one of peculiar
susceptibility to doubt. It is notorious that this
is the time when the Sunday-school and the
church are apt to lose their hold on the boys,
and the questionnaires show juvenile atheism as
well as juvenile piety. Sex development cannot
well be the cause both of religion and irreligion.</p>

<p>While conversions are most frequent in the
adolescent period, they occur both before and
after it, as the statistics show. The notable conversions
which have been most far-reaching in
their effects, such as those of Paul, Augustine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and Luther, have occurred after adolescence.
Conversion with Augustine meant the repression
of sex desires and a celibate life, while in the case
of Luther it meant freedom to marry. James observes
that "the effects are infinitely wider than
the alleged causes, and for the most part opposite
in nature."<a name="FNanchor_34_123" id="FNanchor_34_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Paul's conversion and that of
multitudes after him have no suggestion of a
sexual element, and it is notable that men are
apt to become increasingly occupied with religion
in advancing age as the sexual impulse wanes.</p>

<p>The adolescent theory of conversion has, indeed,
a lesson for Christian parents and teachers.
They should urge upon boys and girls decision
and public identification with the church during
this period; but it would be a loss to religion if
religious teachers should forget the profound
psychology of the motto: "Give me a child for
his first seven years, and you can have him for
the rest of his life." As Stevens says: "We cannot
wait till adolescence is reached before we
win the soul for God. That would be fatally
late. The boy must know that the highest is
the highest when he sees it, and must have been
prepared to love it."<a name="FNanchor_35_124" id="FNanchor_35_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The profound emotional
disturbance of puberty is not regeneration in the
Christian sense, while at that time the conditions
for it may be peculiarly favourable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

<p>2. Midway between those explanations of religion
which refer it to a physical and to a supernatural
cause is the psychological theory advocated
by James, that the special seat or source of
the religious life is in the Subconscious. While
the "subliminal" and the "subconscious" are
newcomers in psychology, they have already
played a considerable rôle in religious discussion,
and have been used in illustration and even
in reconstruction of theological doctrine. Multiple
personality illustrates the Trinity; the subconscious
is made, as in Sanday's "Christologies
Ancient and Modern," the sphere of the divine
nature of Christ; and psychical research is
looked to by some as a hopeful reinforcement
or scientific demonstration of the doctrine of a
future life.</p>

<p>The subconscious is used in a rather loose way
by popular and even by scientific writers. James
regards it as "nowadays a well-accredited psychological
entity,"<a name="FNanchor_36_125" id="FNanchor_36_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> while Pratt refers to the use
that is made of it as "rather questionable psychology."<a name="FNanchor_37_126" id="FNanchor_37_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Some of its possible and legitimate
meanings are: (<i>a</i>) Those hereditary dispositions
which, unknown to the man himself, largely shape
his actions; or (<i>b</i>) the psychophysical machinery
of habitualized action. As Jastrow says: "We
rise upon steps of our habitualized selves, grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
familiar to their task."<a name="FNanchor_38_127" id="FNanchor_38_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The subconscious again
(<i>c</i>) may mean that subliminal activity of the mind
which, when the conscious strain of effort and attention
has been unsuccessful, often, as it seems,
does the work for one, recalling the forgotten
name, solving the problem, or even creating a
new product such as a finished song or poem.</p>

<p>Lastly (<i>d</i>) the subconscious may refer to that
more occult sphere to which belong the phenomena
of hypnotism, automatism, multiple personality,
and perhaps telepathy, in virtue of
which the subject performs actions or has ideas
to which his ordinary consciousness gives no
clew. The subconscious in any or all of these
senses is at least the dwelling place of mystery.
Starbuck admits that "what happens below the
threshold of consciousness must, in the nature of
the case, evade analysis."<a name="FNanchor_39_128" id="FNanchor_39_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It is a mysterious
region of shadows, a twilight zone in which the
divine and human may meet. It may be in
itself the source of the religious life, or at least
the channel through which revelation and redemptive
influence may come.</p>

<p>In James' exposition the subconscious part of
a man is the higher part; and man is conscious
that this higher part of himself "is co-terminous
and continuous with a <span class="smcap">more</span> of the same quality,
which is operative in the universe outside of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>
him."<a name="FNanchor_40_129" id="FNanchor_40_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> What is this more? Our point of contact
with it is the subconscious self; and without
asking for the farther limits of the "More," and
"disregarding the over-beliefs," "we have in the
fact that the conscious person is continuous with
a wider self through which saving experiences
come, a positive content of religious experience,
which, it seems to me, is literally and objectively
true as far as it goes."<a name="FNanchor_41_130" id="FNanchor_41_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>James' theory of the subconscious as the
organ of religion can appeal to many undoubted
facts, but if it means, as the tendency of his exposition
indicates, that the subconscious as the
organ of religion has superior moral worth to
the life of full consciousness, it may be insisted
that the subliminal sphere is the source of evil
as well as of good. The subconscious may be
identified with the flesh as well as with the
spirit. If the subconscious, to use Pauline language,
is the medium of higher spiritual influences,
it is also the seat of the "old Adam," of
"sin that dwelleth in me." In this region is to
be found the source alike of the unexpected
heroisms and weaknesses of men, of Peter's
courage before the Council and of his cowardice
before the serving maid. Hereditary and
habitualized dispositions and tendencies are like
the submerged part of an iceberg, and the winds
of conscious resolution and effort are often powerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
against the sweep of the hidden current
beneath.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that "if the grace of
God miraculously operates, it probably operates
through the subliminal door,"<a name="FNanchor_42_131" id="FNanchor_42_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> but it should be
remembered that in this region of the subliminal
there are "dragons" as well as seraphim.
Hypnotic influences may be therapeutic or they
may be baleful, and in the region of the subconscious,
it is hinted, insane delusions and
psychopathic obsessions may find their source.<a name="FNanchor_43_132" id="FNanchor_43_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
The subconscious is a battle-field rather than
itself a source of help, and it cannot be said that
the subconscious man of the shadows, if he exists
in any of the rôles assigned to him, is any better
or more religious than the man who has his
being in the full sunlight of conscious activity.
The psychological explanation of religion, like
the pathological and the sexual, really proves too
much. From all these alleged sources of religious
life, not only saving influences but
destructive influences flow. Royce's criticism is
that "the new doctrine, viewed in one aspect,
seems to leave religion in the comparatively
trivial position of a play with whimsical powers&mdash;a
prey to endless psychological caprices."<a name="FNanchor_44_133" id="FNanchor_44_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>3. Another theory of religion, now popular,
seeks its explanation not in any bodily condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
or stage of growth, nor in any special department
of the mental life, but in the social relationships
of men. Religion becomes a recognition
of social values, "a consciousness of the highest
social values,"<a name="FNanchor_45_134" id="FNanchor_45_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and is practically to be identified
with patriotism, altruism and the vision of the
future of society. "To-day," says Leuba, "most
men and women derive whatever strength they
may have to maintain their integrity and to devote
themselves to the public good from their
respect and love for their family, their friends,
their business associates, and the state, and from
their desire for the respect and love of men,
much more than from any religious conviction.
It is no longer the consciousness of God, but the
consciousness of Man that is the power making
for righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_46_135" id="FNanchor_46_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> No metaphysical assumptions
need be made by this view of religion
except that of the existence of a world of one's
fellow-men, a postulate which seems necessary
even to a functional psychology.</p>

<p>However much in harmony with the spirit of
the age, the social explanation of religion is
one-sided and is inadequate to the depth and
massiveness and infinite perspective of religious
experience. Religion is a triangle with God,
the self and one's brother at its three angles.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Social theory of religion gives no adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
recognition of the worth either of the individual
or of society. The deepest message of religion
is that the soul is worth something to God.
Man, in spite of his social obligations, is not
made simply for his brother. "We die alone,"
Pascal says, and there is a sense in which we live
alone. As a writer on the psychology of the New
Testament says: "The self, according to the New
Testament, is not merely a social self developing
in a community of other finite selves; it is a
divine self realizing its ideal powers of service,
and fulfilling its destiny only in a fellowship with
the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_47_136" id="FNanchor_47_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Unless Humanity is endowed with the attributes
of Deity, as it almost seems to be in the Positivist
ritual, the estimate of society is also lowered
when men are viewed as having relations and obligations
only to one another. As James Ward
has pointed out, Humanity can only have the
significance and sacredness of the individuals
from whom it is abstracted, and if these have no
permanent or enduring worth, no more has Humanity.<a name="FNanchor_48_137" id="FNanchor_48_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The humanitarian view narrows too much
the horizons of religion. It would exclude from
religion the sense of infinite dependence, and of
devotion to and communion with a personal
higher Power. A religion of humanity merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
will seem superficial to the mood which cries out,
"My soul is athirst for God," or "I seek <i>Thee</i> in
order that my soul may live." If the religion of
the anchorite was one-sided, so equally is that of
the humanitarian.<a name="FNanchor_49_138" id="FNanchor_49_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Neither sin nor righteousness
can be interpreted in exclusively social terms,
unless the conception of the community be so enlarged
as to include the Great Companion and
the Great Demander. The social theory, again,
has no apparent place for the religion of solitude
which finds God in nature. A New England
writer says of Mount Ranier:</p>

<p>"I saw the mountain three years ago: Would
that it might ever be my lot to see it again! I
love to dream of its glory, and its vast whiteness
is a moral force in my life." "Climb the mountains,"
says one of the best known of American
mountaineers, John Muir, "and get their good
tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine
flows into trees. The winds will blow their
freshness into you, and the storms their energy,
while care will drop off like autumn leaves."<a name="FNanchor_50_139" id="FNanchor_50_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The religion of humanity must look outside
itself for its highest inspiration for social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
service and for the norm of social progress. It
was Christianity that created the atmosphere in
which "the enthusiasm of humanity" and zeal for
social service could flourish. Christianity has
emphasized the value of the individual, and the
sacredness of family relationships and the brother-hood
of the children of the one Father. Without
divine love as its pattern and inspiration human
love would lose in comprehension and in intensity.</p>

<p>Society in its progress has ever waited for the
signal to be given by some prophet from the deserts,
or some seer who has brought from the
mount of vision the pattern of a better social
order. Those who see in social service the essence
of religion are faced with the paradox that
the wisest and most beneficent social influences
have flowed from those experiences in which the
individual turned his back on society and flaunted
its ideals. A declaration of independence of
society seems needed before there can be the
most effective social service. By an unsocial act
Abraham left his country and his kindred and his
father's house, and yet in him all the families of
the earth have been blessed; through Paul's unsocial
act in deserting the traditions of his
fathers, the course of Western civilization has
been profoundly influenced; George Fox's unsocial
act in depriving his town of the services of
a useful tradesman, and making for himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
suit of leather, has been called by an acute observer,
Carlyle, doubtless by an over-emphasis,
the greatest event of modern history. Religion,
in fact, first asserts itself as something over and
above all social relations before its social mission
can be performed.</p>

<p>4. The interpretation of religious experience
by the psychologists has not always been favourable
to theistic or Christian belief, but the failure
of other explanations, if established, will lead us
to seek a more adequate one by referring to a
Reality transcending human experience and social
relationships. The study of religious psychology
has, in fact, furnished a broad basis from
which a metaphysical or theistic inference can be
drawn. Such an inference, cumulative in its effect,
may be drawn from the universality of religious
belief, from the imperativeness of social
obligations implying a supersocial sanction, and
from the regenerative effects of religion to an adequate
cause. "God is real since He produces
real effects."<a name="FNanchor_51_140" id="FNanchor_51_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But the study of religious experience
has not only strengthened the older theistic
arguments, but has in effect formulated two
new arguments, the pragmatic and the mystical.</p>

<p>The Pragmatic Argument for theism has been
stated by James in the spirit of his later philosophy.
Taking religions as including creeds and
faith-states, James says that without regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
their truth "we are obliged, on account of their
extraordinary influence on action and endurance,
to class them amongst the most important biological
functions of mankind."<a name="FNanchor_52_141" id="FNanchor_52_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The pragmatic
argument would then run: "The uses of religion,
its uses to the individual who has it, and
the uses of the individual himself to the world,
are the best arguments that truth is in it."<a name="FNanchor_53_142" id="FNanchor_53_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
There is a satisfaction, a fullness of life, an energy
and an expansiveness flowing from religion which
are not enjoyed apart from it, and its usefulness,
from this standpoint, is a guarantee of its truth.
It is merely to state this argument in the more
familiar terms of cause and effect to say as James
does elsewhere that "work is actually done upon
our finite personalities, for we are turned into new
men, and consequences in the way of conduct
follow in the natural world upon our regenerative
change."<a name="FNanchor_54_143" id="FNanchor_54_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> God is real since He produces real
effects.</p>

<p>The Mystical Argument for theism is based on
the claim that in religious experience there is a
more immediate certainty of the presence of God
and a stronger assurance of His existence than
can be gained from purely intellectual processes.
This evidence, it is clear, may be of the strongest
possible kind to the mystic himself, but may seem
to be weak or even negligible to the outsider,
since the experience in the nature of the case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
private and incommunicable. Before the mystical
claim is appraised we must distinguish
further the various kinds of mysticism. We
must distinguish between the absorption of the
Buddhist with his passion for annihilation, and
the Christian's delight in the Lord; and between
a mysticism which means identity of substance
and the deification of man, and a moral mysticism
which realizes at once that God is infinitely near
in His grace but infinitely far in His holiness.</p>

<p>It is fair to ask whether the assurance of the
presence of God enjoyed by many Christians
in all ages, according to their testimony, is
immediate or inferred knowledge, and whether
it should be called knowledge or faith. The
answer of the mystic might be that there is
a "felt indubitable certainty of experience"
which is not dependent on the solution of
epistemological problems. Otherwise we could
not be sure of our own existence or of that
of our fellows until we had specialized in the
theory of knowledge and solved the problem,
which has haunted modern philosophy, of the
knowledge of other selves. If it be objected
again that a subjective experience cannot ground
an inference to an objective, and much less to a
supernatural, cause,<a name="FNanchor_55_144" id="FNanchor_55_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> it may be said that the experience
itself, if correctly reported, is supernatural
in character. Whether it be Paul's "peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
that passes understanding," or Peter's "joy unspeakable
and full of glory," or Edwards' "inward
sweet delight in God and divine things,"
or a modern scientist's consciousness of the presence
of God, said to be "as strong and real to
me as that of any bodily presence,"<a name="FNanchor_56_145" id="FNanchor_56_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> it is of such
a character that no other inference than that to
a supernatural cause can properly be drawn.
The mystical argument is not based like the
other arguments of natural theology upon the
regular course of things, but upon what claims to
be a new supernatural experience, a new life with
new capacities and powers, and new emotions
and insights.</p>

<p>It must be noticed, in conclusion, that the evidence
which the psychologists have so industriously
collected, showing that religion is good
for the individual and for society, has been taken
almost exclusively from the circle of Christian
influences. We might paraphrase James' pragmatic
argument and say that Christianity is true
because it is good for the individual and for society.
His argument from cause might also be
applied to Christianity, for the mystical experiences
adduced are in great measure not merely
those of communion with God but of communion
with God in and through Christ. By no analysis
in fact, as D. W. Forrest says, is the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
"able to distinguish his communion with the
Father from his communion with Christ. They
are blended as consciously real in one indivisible
experience."<a name="FNanchor_57_146" id="FNanchor_57_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The testimony of Christian experience
is to a Power and a Presence which the
Christian feels only as he hears and accepts the
gospel message and looks to Christ for forgiveness,
guidance, and help. "A man who is converted,
in the New Testament sense, is one who
has surrendered to a force immeasurably greater
than anything he has of himself; one who has
awakened to the overwhelming consciousness of
a spiritual world brought to a focus before him
in the Person of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_58_147" id="FNanchor_58_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The Christian
believes that he receives grace from the Father
and the Son. "When Jesus deals with us and
works within us, He does what only God can do.
All Christian experience is nothing if it is not
this."<a name="FNanchor_59_148" id="FNanchor_59_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>After all the secret of the Lord, known to
Christians in the catacombs at Rome as they
sang, "Jesu, Amor Meus," known to medieval
Christians as they sang "Jesu, Dulcis Memoria,"
and known equally to modern Christians who
sing "Jesus, Lover of My Soul," is with them
that fear Him. It has been well said that Christianity<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
must be known from the inside, if it is to
be known at its full worth. In the nature of the
case the evidence of Christian experience is not
demonstrative to an outsider. It can come to
him only in the way of an appeal: "Come and
see; taste and see that the Lord is good."</p>

<h2>The Christian Faith and Recent Philosophy</h2>


<p>The two systems of philosophy which
were dominant at the turn of the century
were unfriendly to theistic and
Christian belief. Naturalism on the one hand
and Absolutism on the other could find no place
for a positive faith in God, freedom and immortality.
The opening years of the century witnessed
a revolt against these two systems; and
the leading characteristic of twentieth century
thought, over against an agnostic naturalism and
a pantheistic or impersonal absolutism, has been
its reaffirmation of spiritual values. There has
been a new emphasis upon the rights of personality,
as against the enmeshing and enchaining
forces of nature on the one hand and an all-engulfing
Absolute on the other.</p>

<p>Philosophical readers will remember the moral
tonic of James' collection of essays, "The Will to
Believe" (1902), with its picturesque style, its
originality of standpoint and its moral enthusiasm.
Here was a philosopher of medical training and
of unquestioned scientific standing, and yet with
the insight and earnestness of a prophet, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
a valiant defense of spiritual realities, of human
freedom, and the rights of the volitional and
moral sides of our nature. As an evolutionist
he contended that "the strenuous type of character
will on the battle-field of human history always
outwear the easy-going type, and religion
will drive irreligion to the wall."<a name="FNanchor_1_149" id="FNanchor_1_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> And as a
psychologist he found that theism appealed to
every energy of our active nature and released
the springs of every emotion, and held that
"infra-theistic conceptions, materialism and
agnosticism, are irrational because they are
inadequate stimuli to man's practical nature."<a name="FNanchor_2_150" id="FNanchor_2_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Readers who had been breathing the stifling
air of naturalism, so fatal to spiritual aspiration,
or the too rarified atmosphere of absolutism with
its "transcendence" of personality and moral
distinctions, will remember also the sense of satisfaction
and relief with which they read that other
volume of protest, from the other side of the
water, "Personal Idealism" (1902). It was refreshing
to find that there was a body of brilliant
young thinkers, alive to the scientific atmosphere
of the time, and trained in the philosophic orthodoxy
of the English schools, and yet boldly asserting
the rights of personality in God and man.</p>

<p>This twofold protest against a denial, from
whatever side, of the rights of personality was
organized into the movement we call Pragmatism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
under the leadership of William James,
ably assisted by F. C. S. Schiller in Oxford and
John Dewey in this country.<a name="FNanchor_3_151" id="FNanchor_3_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It is not to be
wondered at if this reaction went too far, as the
pendulum swung from the extreme of Being to
that of Becoming. We find Pragmatism, reacting
against monism, whether materialistic or
idealistic, going over to pluralism; from the extreme
of a "block universe" in which time is
nothing passing to the other extreme of a
"strung-along universe" in which time is everything;
from pantheism going over to a vaguely
indicated polytheism; from an absolute truth
and an absolute Being sitting in smiling repose
above the strife of time to a "God in the dirt"
and a truth that could be made, or unmade,
perhaps too easily.</p>

<p>Our discussion will be more concrete if we select
leading representatives from the four nations
most addicted to philosophy, and examine their
attitude towards the Christian Faith and towards
its theistic foundations.</p>
<br>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Bergson and Creative Evolution</span></p>

<p>In close relation to the pragmatic movement,
and set forth with a wonderful magic of
style, is the philosophy of Henri Bergson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which finds its mature expression in his "Creative
Evolution." It is a remarkable testimony
to the wealth of suggestion and many-sidedness
of Bergson's philosophy that its support
has been claimed by a number of movements
of diverse aim. Modernists in theology,
syndicalists in the sphere of social agitation, and
even, it is said, cubists in art, appeal to Bergson
for philosophical support; and affinities have been
pointed out between his <i>élan vital</i> and Schopenhauer's
will-to-live, Von Hartmann's philosophy
of the unconscious, and Nietzsche's aggressive
individualism. We must ask whether his <i>élan
vital</i> can be baptized, and his "Creative Evolution"
be made the basis for a spiritual philosophy.</p>

<p>It will be useful to notice some features of
Bergson's system before attempting to estimate
its bearings upon religious problems. The story
of evolution as Bergson describes it, certainly in
an engaging manner, is a drama in three acts.
The <i>élan vital</i>, or otherwise consciousness, is the
hero, but is imprisoned by matter (the villain),
and is striving blindly for release. In the first
act, the vital impulse tunnels its way through the
opposing element of matter into the vegetable
world. The result is only the lethargy and immobility
of vegetable forms, and is so far a failure.
The next act finds consciousness working
its way into the animal world and attaining mobility
and becoming in so far free from the entanglements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of matter; but here again there is
partial failure. Consciousness is arrested at the
stage of instinct, and, resting content with a response
to the environment which is patterned
after the mechanical action of matter, fails to attain
freedom. In the third act, "by a tremendous
leap," consciousness, in spite of the efforts of
matter to drag it down to the plane of mechanism,
reaches at last spontaneity and freedom in man.
The drama reaches its <i>dénouement</i> in man and his
ability not only to move in response to environment,
but to control the environment. It is intimated
that there may be a sequel, in which life
pursues its career in another stage of existence.</p>

<p>1. It is evident at a glance that the view of
evolution here set forth in barest outline offers
many points of contrast to what has been accepted
as evolutionary orthodoxy. The history
of life with both Darwin and Bergson is a struggle:
but with Darwin it is a struggle for existence,
with Bergson a struggle for freedom, for
efficiency, for complexity. With Darwin there
is a struggle of living beings with one another,
conceived after the analogy of economic competition;
with Bergson there is a struggle of life
against matter and necessity. The struggle for
existence, in a sense, has been moralized. It is
a struggle for the existence and higher life of
consciousness.</p>

<p>2. Creative evolution is not materialistic evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
for life is not a development from matter
but is an upward tendency opposing the downward
current of matter. The increasing complexity
of living forms is not the result of the
movements of matter, or of chemical-physical
laws, but of an opposition, successful in a unique
degree in men, to the imprisoning and entangling
forces of matter.</p>

<p>3. The later stages in evolution, while connected
with the earlier in continuity of development,
may contain elements that are essentially
new. A living being is "a reservoir of indetermination
and unforeseeability."<a name="FNanchor_4_152" id="FNanchor_4_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The new
species cannot be explained, except by an illegitimate
process of thought, by what is presented in
the old. The appearance of a new species is
something as new as the composition of a symphony
of Beethoven. Man, then, in his powers
and destinies is not to be judged by his likeness
to the brutes, but by what he possesses over
and above the qualities of animal life, by those
achievements and endowments to which animals
have failed to attain. Since man, and man alone,
has come so far, and in him alone consciousness
has broken the chains of mechanical necessity,
"we shall have no repugnance in admitting that
in man, though perhaps in man alone, consciousness
pursues its path beyond this earthly life."<a name="FNanchor_5_153" id="FNanchor_5_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

<p>4. Creative evolution is the antithesis of mechanical
evolution. Bergson protests that the
conception of mechanism as applied to life is inadequate,
because (1) it is artificial, growing out
of our habits of controlling matter. It is an instrument
of the intelligence, not giving us an
insight into life, which we must gain rather in
intuition, the higher faculty in Bergson's system.
A mechanical representation of nature is always
a "representation necessarily artificial and symbolic."<a name="FNanchor_6_154" id="FNanchor_6_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
(2) Mechanical conceptions are inapplicable
to living beings, because of the irreversibility
of the movements of living forms; and
(3) the mechanical theory is negatived by the
facts of the psychophysical connection. "The
hypothesis of an equivalence between the psychical
state and the cerebral state implies a veritable
absurdity, as we tried to prove in a former
work."<a name="FNanchor_7_155" id="FNanchor_7_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> No mechanical theory and no theory
of accidental variations, whether insensible or
abrupt, can account for the production of so
complex an organ as the eye.<a name="FNanchor_8_156" id="FNanchor_8_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>His critique of other theories prepares the way
for Bergson's own view that the forms of living
beings are due to an original vital impulsion,
not in the single organism, but in life as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
seeking, without foresight of the result, to overcome
the downward tendency of matter.</p>

<p>Bergson's suggested <i>via media</i> between creationism
and evolutionism, his rejection of a theory
of chance variations, and his vigorous polemic
against mechanism, all seem to prepare the way
for a spiritualistic philosophy. It is true that the
land of the spirit has not yet been explored, but
Bergson, as one writer expresses it, has at least
thrown a bridge across the chasm between the
material and the spiritual. While his "Creative
Evolution" has been placed upon the Index, we
must remember that he himself claims that this
work and those that preceded it have resulted in
the conceptions of liberty, of spirit and of creation.
"From all this," as he says, "we derive a
clear idea of a free and creating God, producing
matter and life at once, whose creative effort is
continued, in a vital direction, by the evolution
of species and the construction of human personalities."<a name="FNanchor_9_157" id="FNanchor_9_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The point in Bergson's system which seems
least in harmony with theistic belief is his criticism
and rejection of finalism. Bergson fears
that the temporal series will be swallowed up in
the "dark backward and abysm of time," or rather
of eternity. The finalism of a foreseen end means
with him fatalism, fixity, with no play for freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and a reality in time only of a secondary
order. Again, in opposition to finalism he urges
the variety of living forms. Could the end of all
the varied history be merely the production of
man? This cannot be proved, because everywhere
we see in nature contingency and variety,
and apparent cross-purposes if purpose at all.
There is no single line of evolution leading
up to man. Some fossil forms from remote
periods show exactly the same structure as living
forms to-day. Further, the vital impulse
striving towards freedom meets with obstacles,
and failure and arrest are manifest in the lethargy
of vegetables and the mechanical reflexes
of animals, if these are viewed with reference to
the assumed end of the creation of man. The
only finalism which Bergson will admit is that of
a push towards freedom in virtue of an original
vital impulse, blindly and often vainly seeking
to overcome the movement of matter towards
necessity. It is a <i>vis a tergo</i> happening at last
to issue, without any foresight of the result, in
the appearance of man.</p>

<p>It is not clear, however, that Bergson has been
able to dispose of finalism, or to find some conception
between it and the theory of chance
which he rejects. The disc of a talking machine,
to one not familiar with it, with its spiral lines
broken in a haphazard way, would seem to exclude
purpose; but when it is properly adjusted<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>
the voice of a Melba or a Caruso can be heard.
So there may be some standpoint from which
the bewildering variety of nature will reveal some
unitary purpose. It may be, to use the figure of
the artist, that the purpose is not solely the production
of man, but that the variety and beauty of
the natural world is an expression of the joy of the
Creative Artist in his work. The purpose may be
more comprehensive, and the fact that all natural
history does not plainly lead to the production
of man is not in itself a proof that man was not
the intended consummation of the process.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Bergson, a master in the
use of illustration, cannot find any exact illustration
of the kind of evolution he wishes to describe.
He compares the course of evolution to
a road, leading to a city, but hastens to add that,
for evolution, the end of the road is not seen.<a name="FNanchor_10_158" id="FNanchor_10_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
He says again that "if one wished to express
himself in terms of finality, it must be said that
consciousness ... has sought an issue in
the double direction of instinct and intelligence.
It has not found it in instinct and it has not obtained
it upon the side of intelligence, except
by a sudden leap from animal to man. So that,
in the last analysis, man would be the <i>raison
d' être</i> of the entire organization of life upon our
planet."<a name="FNanchor_11_159" id="FNanchor_11_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He adds again, however, that this<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
would be but a manner of speaking, and that
there is nothing in reality but a certain current
of existence and an antagonistic current, whence
all the evolution of life. Once more it will be
asked, how is this sudden leap, so tremendous
in its consequences, to be conceived? Is it a
leap in the dark, like the leap of a fish from
the water into a rowboat? Is man thus only a
happy accident? Or must we see in the vital
impulse, or behind it, some real instrumentality
of guidance? If the original current of life is
wholly blind and purposeless, it would arrive
nowhere, or else its arrival at humanity would
be as much the result of chance as if it were due
to a fortuitous collocation of atoms.</p>

<p>But let us return to Bergson's favourite and
beautiful figure of the artist. The effort to objectify
the ideal, and to put it in concrete form
in words or upon canvas, is said to be precious
though painful. It is precious and more precious
than the work it results in, "because, thanks
to it, we have drawn from ourselves not only all
there was there, but more than was there: we
have raised ourselves above ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_12_160" id="FNanchor_12_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Is the Divine Artist subject to this kind of
evolution? In moments of creative activity
does He thus avail Himself of a "plus-power"
in the universe, to use Emerson's expression,
and does He thus, like the human artist, raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Himself above Himself? If so, we must think of
God as altogether such a one as we are, rather
than as the source and ground of being and the
life and light of men. Such a deity is rather to
be identified with the stream of life than with the
Ultimate lying behind both life and matter. The
Divine Artist, so conceived, would lack the clearness
of human prevision of ends, and would be
of a relatively lower order of endowment. The
striving of the vital impulse without foresight of
an end is of an infra-human rather than a super-human
kind; for even a "complete and perfect
humanity," Bergson says, "would be that in
which these two forms of conscious activity
[intuition and intelligence] attain their full development."<a name="FNanchor_13_161" id="FNanchor_13_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>A recent critic has said that while Bergson has
removed the mechanical obstacles to liberty he
has not discovered the spiritual conditions requisite
for it, and that "he has, most unintentionally,
brought us back, in this anti-Finalism,
to that Naturalism which he has so successfully
resisted when it masqueraded as a sheer Mechanism."<a name="FNanchor_14_162" id="FNanchor_14_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
There can be no doubt that the spirit
of his philosophy is one of progress, and that the
tendency of his thought is spiritualistic; his
<i>élan vital</i> is an <i>élan en avant</i>, and his God (if
one be admitted in his system) is a God of hope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
But the questions will still arise whether the vital
impulse means for society a destructive radicalism
or a constructive renewal; whether, in its
ethical aspect, it means a will-to-live no matter
what happens to any one else, or a will-to-live-better;
and whether it will eventually be transformed
into a pessimistic resignation or transmuted
into spiritual aspiration.</p>

<p>In the religious aspect of his philosophy,
Bergson stands at the parting of the ways. He
must associate with creation not merely an impulse
vaguely psychical, but the personal attributes
of will, intelligence and purpose, and so
advance towards theism; or else he must be content
to rest in naturalism, albeit of a glorified type.</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Eucken and the Truth of Religion</span></p>

<p>Since the death of William James, the brightest
stars in the philosophical firmament have
been Henri Bergson of Paris and Rudolf Eucken
of Jena. One reason for the popularity of both
is that the centre of interest in their best-known
works is not in epistemology. They do not approach
the problem of existence as beholders,
merely asking how they can see, and whether
what they see is real, but their standpoint is that
of intimate, vital human experience. Both writers
place themselves in the stream of life, and find
that the moments of deepest insight into reality
are those of creative activity in art or other constructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of the mind, or else, with Eucken, of
moral achievement and victory.</p>

<p>Eucken has been called the German Emerson,
and his message to his time is that of a seer
rather than of a systematizer. He is the prophet
of a spiritual life, protesting against materialism
and secularism, and vindicating the sovereign
rights of the spiritual aspects of existence. In
the term "Activism," which he applies to his
philosophy, he intimates that there must be an
activity of the soul upon its material and social
environment, before the insights of philosophy
and the achievements of art and the experiences
of religion can be attained. There must be an
assertion by the soul of its own spiritual nature.
The conviction that man is not merely the product
of nature, but in his spiritual life is independent
and supreme, is not the result of a revelation
to a passive recipient. It is an achievement, a
venture of faith, a self-assertion of the soul in
the face of hostile forces which would confine it
within the trivial and the phenomenal.</p>

<p>Eucken's relation to Christianity will appear
if we notice briefly (1) his critique of other philosophical
theories; (2) his own constructive theory
of religion; and (3) his answer to the question,
Can we still be Christians?</p>

<p>1. As an exponent of the "monistic trinity"
of the Good, the Beautiful, and the True, Eucken
is brought into comparison with his famous colleague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Haeckel, with whose "brand-new monism"
he has little sympathy. Against Naturalism,
Eucken holds that the life of man in its ideal
constructions such as science, art, morality and
religion, cannot be explained from below, but
only from the Higher in him and above him.
From the material supplied to it by nature the
soul, out of its own activity, builds the more
stately mansions of science, philosophy, art,
social organization and religion. "A consistent
naturalism," he contends, "is not able to permit
science of any kind. Science is constructed
through the activity of the human mind alone."<a name="FNanchor_15_163" id="FNanchor_15_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Against Pragmatism, with which Eucken's
Activism has some superficial resemblance, he
argues for the "independent character of reality
over against our experience of it." He believes
that our deepest nature can be called into action
only by the recognition of an Ought, which has
an existence and value of its own, regardless of
the opinions of any group of individuals or of
the whole human race. "When the good of the
individual and of humanity becomes the highest
aim and the guiding principle, truth sinks to the
level of a merely utilitarian opinion....
Truth can exist only as an end in itself. 'Instrumental'
truth is no truth at all."<a name="FNanchor_16_164" id="FNanchor_16_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>


<p>The method of the intellectualist as well as of
the voluntarist is inadequate to reach the truth
of religion. Religion should be a fact of the
whole man, and of his own decision, and it
should recognize by a unique experience, which
cannot be called exclusively feeling or thought
or will, an encompassing and basal whole.
Thought "left simply to its own resources would
never be able to get beyond empty forms and
highly abstract conceptions."<a name="FNanchor_17_165" id="FNanchor_17_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> No merely intellectual
form of religion is able to overcome
doubt. Thus "the transformation of the Spiritual
Life into an impersonal thought-process
destroys it to its very foundation."</p>

<p>2. This effort, already in part described, to
assert an independent spiritual world over
against a natural world, this recognition of over-individual
standards and of an absolute, self-subsistent
Spiritual Life (<i>Geistesleben</i>), is called
Universal Religion. The term Godhead to indicate
this conception is in some ways preferable
to that of God. A higher stage of religion is indicated
by Eucken's term Characteristic Religion,
by which is meant a deeper insight into the divine,
a more personal experience of the divine
energy of Spiritual Life. Universal Religion, it
may be said, is the demand or the feeling after
God; while Characteristic Religion is the supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
or the finding of God. In the effort to conform
to the over-individual standards and to attain
harmony with the divine, there is an inevitable
sense of weakness and failure. It becomes evident
that man's own energy cannot save him
from inner discord. "If a rescue is possible,
Divine power and grace must do the work.
That such power and grace really accomplish
this, is the fundamental conviction of religion."<a name="FNanchor_18_166" id="FNanchor_18_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
There originates a mutual intercourse with the
soul and God as between an I and a Thou; and
"consequently, there culminates here a movement
away from the colourless conception of the
Godhead to that of a living and personal God."<a name="FNanchor_19_167" id="FNanchor_19_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Eucken's teaching has been called a philosophical
restatement of Christianity. He reiterates
in philosophical language the theological
doctrines of sin, of the new birth, of divine grace,
and of the supremacy of Christian love. His
argument for immortality is the religious argument:
"The Infinite Power and Love that has
grounded a new spontaneous nature in man,
over against a dark and hostile world, will conserve
such a new nature and its spiritual nucleus,
and shelter it against all perils and assaults, so
that life as the bearer of life eternal can never be
wholly lost in the stream of time."<a name="FNanchor_20_168" id="FNanchor_20_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

<p>3. From our exposition thus far it would
seem unnecessary to ask the question, Can we
still be Christians? and we are not surprised that
Eucken's answer is, "We not only can but must
be Christians."<a name="FNanchor_21_169" id="FNanchor_21_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> A closer examination of his
teaching shows that this question, and even the
previous question, Can we still be theists? may
naturally be raised. It is true that Eucken recoils
from pantheism as lessening the energy of
life,<a name="FNanchor_22_170" id="FNanchor_22_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and declares that the transcendence of the
Divine must be asserted; but on the other hand
we are warned that "the notion of the personal
is here only a symbol for something transcending
all conceptions and words."<a name="FNanchor_23_171" id="FNanchor_23_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It is too emotional
and anthropomorphic. Eucken will not
declare unqualified allegiance either to pantheism,
to theism in its usual form or to agnosticism.
In the Spiritual Life the opposition of monism
and dualism, and apparently of the personal and
the impersonal, are transcended. The overcoming
of opposites in a way impossible for reason
is precisely the office and prerogative of religion.
It is to be noticed in his account of spiritual life
that prayer, "the core of religion," is singularly
absent; and in his exposition of Christianity he
gives no prominence to the Fatherhood of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
central as that conception was in the teaching of
Jesus.</p>

<p>With the doctrine of personality thus loosely
held, it is no wonder that there are many elements
in Christianity as usually understood
which are uncongenial to Eucken's mode of
thought. We cannot, he says, confine the union
of God and man to one unique instance, and we
must demand an immediate relationship between
God and man throughout the whole breadth of
the Spiritual Life; nor can we make the expression
of divine love and grace dependent upon
its one expression in Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_24_172" id="FNanchor_24_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> One time
cannot set the standard for all time,<a name="FNanchor_25_173" id="FNanchor_25_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> nor one
historical person, absolutely, for all persons.
The denial of sensible miracle, he allows, cuts
deep into historical Christianity, but such a
denial is necessary.<a name="FNanchor_26_174" id="FNanchor_26_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> To affirm miracle is to
make the spiritual too dependent on the sensible,
and such a central miracle as the Resurrection
"would mean an overthrow of the total order of
nature, as this has been set forth through the
work of modern investigation."<a name="FNanchor_27_175" id="FNanchor_27_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>However great the figure of Jesus may be, His
greatness must be confined to the realm of humanity.
"If Jesus, therefore, is not God, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Christ is not the second Person in the Trinity,
then He is man; not a man like any average
man among us, but still man. We can, then, revere
Him as a leader, a hero, a martyr; but we
cannot directly bind ourselves to Him or root
ourselves in Him (<i>bei ihm festlegen</i>); we cannot
submit to Him unconditionally. Still less can
we make Him the object of a cult. To do so
would be nothing less than an intolerable deification
of a human being."<a name="FNanchor_28_176" id="FNanchor_28_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>What of those, we may ask, who in religious
experience find themselves "rooted and
grounded" in Christ? Eucken's readers cannot
expect relief from this quarter, for religious experience,
he holds, is too subjective and human
to ground an inference to the nature of Spiritual
Life.<a name="FNanchor_29_177" id="FNanchor_29_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It is evident that Eucken has cut deep
into Christianity alike on its historical, its doctrinal
and its experiential sides. He distinguishes
between form and substance, but acknowledges
that "religion has lost unspeakably much through
the upheaval of the old form";<a name="FNanchor_30_178" id="FNanchor_30_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and that this
must somehow be made good. We might, without
violence in the comparison, imagine the case
of a Mohammedan who, trained in modern modes<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>
of thought but clinging to old associations, asked
himself the question, Can we still be Mohammedans?
"Yes," he might reply, "but we must
retain only the essence or soul of Mohammedanism&mdash;its
monotheism. The historical body or existential
form of Mohammedanism, namely, that
Mohammed was the prophet of God and that the
Koran is a revelation from heaven, must be given
up. And even when we speak of the unity and
personality of God, we must remember that we
are employing symbol and metaphor."</p>

<p>Eucken presents the remarkable phenomenon
of a man whose thought is saturated with Christian
influence, who appreciates the moral power
and splendour of Christianity and its regenerative
effects in history, and yet is unable to reconcile
its distinctive features with the fundamental concepts
of his philosophy. He shows the close
connection of the questions, What think ye of
Christ? and, What think ye of God? and that
assured belief in the personality of God and in
His incarnation in a Person belong together.
"No one cometh to the Father but by me."
That a Christianity such as Eucken preaches, removed
from supports in history, in authoritative
doctrine, in religious experience, perhaps even
in a rational theism, can retain its moral power
and act as a spiritual lever for the elevation
either of the masses or the classes, remains to be
proved.</p>

<p>Our twentieth century philosophers are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
prophets of a new age. Bergson's teaching
opens before each individual and before humanity
new possibilities of achievement, as, in
obedience to the vital impulse, the army of humanity
rushes on "in an overwhelming charge,
able to beat down every resistance and clear
the most formidable obstacles, perhaps even
death."<a name="FNanchor_31_179" id="FNanchor_31_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Eucken, with the more serious burden
of a moral message, has proclaimed with voice
and pen the gospel of a new spiritual life and a
new spiritual world. Do not these twentieth
century prophets reëcho in a certain sense, each
in his own language, the message which was
heard among the Galilean hills in an age from
which the centuries are measured, "Repent, for
the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"?</p>
<br>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Ward and the Realm of Ends</span></p>

<p>Our English speaking philosophers, in the
more usual fashion, base their religious philosophy
upon a theory of knowledge. It is noticeable,
however, that both James Ward and Josiah
Royce, while belonging to the idealistic tradition
coming down from Kant and Hegel, show the
influence of a revolt from that tradition. Ward
begins with the many, with pluralism, while he
ends with the one; and Royce declares himself
an advocate of Absolute Pragmatism.</p>

<p>The great services of Ward to religious philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in his "Realm of Ends" are, first, his
transition from pluralism to theism, and, second,
his demonstration anew of the strength of the
philosophical argument for immortality.</p>

<p>1. His theistic argument in a nutshell is this,
that while there is no road from the One to the
Many, there is an open road from the Many to
the One, with sign-posts upon the way. We
must start with pluralism, says Ward, because
no reason can be given why the One, in whatever
way conceived, should become the Many.
Why should the homogeneous become heterogeneous,
or the indeterminate determinate, or
why should the absolute become split up into
finite spirits? A creation out of nothing cannot,
for Ward, solve the problem, for his conception
of creation is that of "intellective intuition," in
which God as subject is necessary to the existence
of the world as object, but the world, from
this standpoint, is equally necessary to God.</p>

<p>There is no way of passing, then, from an
absolute One to the Many, from singularism to
pluralism. We must start with Babel and
achieve, if we can, "one language and one
speech." In its modern form Pluralism is a
revolt alike from nineteenth century Absolutism,
which was the dominant school in Germany and
England, and from the Naturalism brought to
the fore by the advance of scientific research, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>
interpreting mind in terms of nature. Pluralism
has been called a means of escape alike from
"Naturalism's desert and the barren summit of
the Absolute." The ancient pluralism took the
form of atomism, but the concourse of atoms
may account for rigidity and uniformity but not
for spontaneity. The modern type of pluralism,
starting at the level of self-consciousness, posits
a multitude of monads or individuals acting
towards self-conservation and self-realization,
and can, it is believed, do full justice alike to law
and contingency, to spontaneity and fixity. The
pluralist, operating on the principle of continuity,
assumes that there are conscious individuals or
monads in various degrees lower than man down
to the minimal point of complete unconsciousness;
and higher consciousnesses than man up
to a being who may be called in a sense supreme,
but is never more than one of the many, not
inclusive of them, and, however exalted, is never
more than <i>primus inter pares</i>.</p>

<p>The modern pluralist as described by Ward
is a "pampsychist"; he believes that all existence
is soul-like. There is a multiplicity of soul-like
beings of various grades of development,
some dominating, some serving, "conative and
cognitive individuals bent on self-conservation
and seeking the good."<a name="FNanchor_32_180" id="FNanchor_32_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> All existence is soul-like,
although, in what we call inorganic matter,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>
these cognitive and conative monads have been
largely "denatured" and reduced to the semblance
of mechanism and routine. They have
become "finished and finite clods, untroubled by
a spark."</p>

<p>The pluralist assumes at the outset a multiplicity
of soul-like beings; but he cannot explain
satisfactorily their inter-action, or their action
towards a common end. If, indeed, a pluralistic
standpoint were hopelessly infected with contradictions,
as the Eleatics might hold, then
"the way to theism would be hopelessly barred;
for from pluralism speculation really always has
and always must begin."<a name="FNanchor_33_181" id="FNanchor_33_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Pluralism begins
with the many and ends with the many. But
did it really begin at the beginning, and does it
really reach the end? Pluralism, Ward insists,
"points both theoretically and practically [and
both forward and backward] beyond itself."<a name="FNanchor_34_182" id="FNanchor_34_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Following Ward in his transition from pluralism
to theism, we notice: (1) The pluralist stops
with "the totality of a Many in their inter-action
regarded as the ultimate reality." But this
position "is incomplete and unsatisfying. A
plurality of beings primarily independent as
regards their existence and yet always mutually
acting and reacting upon each other, an ontological
plurality that is somehow a cosmological
unity, seems clearly to suggest some ground<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
beyond itself. The idea of God presents itself
to meet this lack." But this idea of God would
be meaningless "unless God were regarded as
transcending the Many; so there can be no talk
of God as merely <i>primus inter pares</i>."<a name="FNanchor_35_183" id="FNanchor_35_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> There
can be no democratic idea of God, for by its
very nature the idea of God implies something
unique and incomparable and sovereign. The
existence of the Many then looks back to the existence
of the One as ground or creator.</p>

<p>The pluralistic view, then, does not, apart
from theism, make a unified world; a pluralistic
universe is in fact a contradiction in terms. Such
a unifying conception as theism affords answers
to the subject in relation to the manifold objects
of experience; in fact it is doubtful if an absolute
pluralism is a possible conception since we never
know of the Many apart from the One. Theism,
again, in its doctrine of a dominant monad and
a supreme world spirit, is in agreement with the
generalizations of science. All theories of the
derivation of finite spirits, whether evolutionist,
creationist, or traducian, agree in deriving the
Many from the One.</p>

<p>(2) The coöperation of the Many also points
in the direction of the One if, as is generally
assumed, this coöperation is towards any common
goal. The coöperation, it may be said, is due to
chance, a fortuitous concourse of purposes; but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
if there is a tendency to one end, the question is
inevitable, Why should the Many tend towards
one end unless they had in the One their source?
Theism is reached as the alternative of supposing
that the inter-actions of the Many are a mere
welter of happenings without meaning or purpose.
Evolution and history show an increase
of complexity and coöperation, and if all things
work together it is natural to believe that all things
work together for good. "The God who knows
all loves all," and only the immanence of God in
the world as defined by theism can give assurance
that the pluralist's ideal will be fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_36_184" id="FNanchor_36_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Apart from theistic belief there would be no
reason to expect progress on the whole, for "a
world entering upon a fresh evolution cannot
start where it left off and may even begin in less
favourable conditions than before." "In a word,
without such spiritual continuity as theism alone
seems able to ensure, it looks as if a pluralistic
world were condemned to a Sisyphean task. <i>Per
aspera ad astra</i> may be its motto, but <i>facilis
descensus Averno</i> seems to be its fate."<a name="FNanchor_37_185" id="FNanchor_37_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Further (3) theism enriches and enhances the
pluralist's ideal by all the ineffable blessedness
that the presence of God must yield. To sum
up: "The theoretical demand for the ground of
the world, then, as well as the practical demand
for the good of the world, is met by the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
God."<a name="FNanchor_38_186" id="FNanchor_38_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> As related to the Many the One is the
"ultimate source of their being and ultimate end
of their ends."<a name="FNanchor_39_187" id="FNanchor_39_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>2. While Ward is a Platonist alike in his
belief in immortality and in connecting that
belief with the doctrines of the preëxistence and
transmigration of souls, his general argument
for a future life follows the more usual lines.
It is based upon both rational and moral
grounds and expressed with unusual beauty and
power.</p>

<p>Man's native capacities and preëminently the
moral law within him point far beyond any ability
he has in the present life, and it is to be assumed,
with Kant, that "no organ, no faculty,
no impulse, in short nothing superfluous or disproportionate
to its use, and therefore aimless, is to
be met with."<a name="FNanchor_40_188" id="FNanchor_40_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Against a continuance of life
there are no valid objections to be raised. We
cannot prove a negative, and the burden of proof
rests with those who deny its possibility. The
immortality of influence or of the race cannot be
substituted for personal immortality. If humanity
or society is an end in itself, "then the persons
who constitute it must share in this end."<a name="FNanchor_41_189" id="FNanchor_41_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> "The
wearisome procession of generation after generation
of mortals in pursuit of an <i>ignis fatuus</i>, all
hoping, all working for what none attain, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
divert a Mephistopheles but would certainly not
be a realm of ends."<a name="FNanchor_42_190" id="FNanchor_42_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The moral arguments for a future life are bound
up with an estimate of the worth of human personality,
but are ultimately rational as well. If
death ends all, not only are we of all creatures
most miserable, but God also, if in this case He
exists, is mocked, and the world whose highest
ideals are not and cannot be fulfilled is without
ultimate meaning. We have then the dilemma:
"Either the world is not rational or man does
not stand alone and this life is not all. But it
cannot be rational to conclude that the world is
not rational, least of all when an alternative is
open to us that leaves room for its rationality&mdash;the
alternative of postulating God and a future life."<a name="FNanchor_43_191" id="FNanchor_43_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>A belief in transmigration is with Ward organically
connected with his pluralism and pampsychism.
For the pluralist "all the individuals
there are have existed from the first and
will continue to exist indefinitely";<a name="FNanchor_44_192" id="FNanchor_44_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and it follows
that "'metempsychosis' in some form seems
an unavoidable corollary of thoroughgoing pampsychism,
so long as we look broadly at the facts
of life as a whole."<a name="FNanchor_45_193" id="FNanchor_45_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The same doctrine that
"all the individuals there are have existed from
the first" affects, it should be noticed, the quality
of Ward's theism. God is not transcendent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
time, for we cannot conceive God without the
world. He is not transcendent as being in His
existence independent of the world, for a God
who is not a creator is an abstraction.<a name="FNanchor_46_194" id="FNanchor_46_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Again
He is not transcendent in the sense that He can
now exercise creative power, for there can be no
new creation since the beginning.</p>

<p>Before pampsychism, with its "unavoidable
corollary" of metempsychosis, is adopted this
theory itself should be subjected to a closer examination.
While pampsychism has undoubted
advantages as a philosophical theory, it has serious
difficulties as well. It appears to have but
slight relation to the progress of science in any
of its lines. The whole scheme of evolution,
from the inorganic through the vegetable to
animal and man, is seriously modified. The
movement is from consciousness to what is called
matter, but consciousness seems to have suffered
a sort of a "fall"; for in the geologic and astronomic
ages before the introduction of life consciousness
was at any rate reduced to the vanishing
point. What, then, of the reality of those
processes which geology and astronomy describe?
Their reality as more than an imaginary prelude to
human or animal life is open to question. The
physiologist, moreover, will contend that there is
no evidence of the presence of consciousness except
in connection with a nervous system, or will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
at most admit a kind of diffused consciousness
in all organic matter. The astronomer, finally,
will think it strange to be told that while "we
cannot, of course, affirm that a star or a meteor
or a cluster of particles is an individual," we
must as pluralists believe "that the real beings
these phenomena imply have some spontaneity
and some initiative."<a name="FNanchor_47_195" id="FNanchor_47_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Both pampsychism and mechanism may be
accused of pushing the principle of continuity too
far. It is an error to reduce all objects and all
activities, all thinking beings and all objects of
our thought, to mechanism and its products and
by-products, thus explaining away the peculiar
nature of man as a conative and cognitive being.
But it is equally an error in the other direction,
it may be contended, to reduce all of reality, by
an exaggeration of anthropomorphism and a return
though in a refined form to the method of
primitive animism, to the analogy of social intercourse.</p>

<p>It is hazardous to stake the interests of theism
upon a technical theory of knowledge such as
that upon which pampsychism is based. One
may gratefully appreciate the cogency and value
of Ward's theistic argument in its general aspects
without being convinced that the doctrine of
pampsychism is the only, or indeed the firmest,
basis upon which theistic belief can be reared.</p>
<br>
<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Royce and the Problem of Christianity</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Our American philosopher, Josiah Royce, has
always been occupied with the religious aspects
of philosophy, but has of late shown a special
interest in the philosophical interpretation of the
doctrines of the Christian Faith. His mature
views are expressed in his essay on "What is
Vital in Christianity?" in his volume, "William
James and Other Essays" (1911), and in his
Lowell lectures, "The Problem of Christianity"
(1913).</p>

<p>Royce believes that if there is to be a philosophy
of religion at all, such a philosophy must
include in its task "the office of a positive and
of a deeply sympathetic interpretation of the
spirit of Christianity, and must be just to the
fact that the Christian religion is, thus far at
least, man's most impressive vision of salvation,
and his principal glimpse of the homeland of
the spirit."<a name="FNanchor_48_196" id="FNanchor_48_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>In Christianity Royce finds a religion of loyalty,
defined as "the practically devoted love of
an individual for a community." Christianity is
in its essence "the most typical, and so far in
human history, the most highly developed religion
of loyalty;"<a name="FNanchor_49_197" id="FNanchor_49_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and it was in Pauline Christianity
that the Christian ideas of the community,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the lost state of the individual and of atonement
or grace first received their full statement,
though not their complete formulation. Paul's
addition to the doctrine of love, thought by himself
to be inspired by the Spirit of the Ascended
Lord, consisted in his placing love to the church
side by side with love to God and to one's neighbour.
"Christian love, as Paul conceived it,
takes on the form of Loyalty. This is Paul's
simple but vast transformation of Christian
love."<a name="FNanchor_50_198" id="FNanchor_50_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The reduction of what is vital in Christianity
to the so-called pure gospel of Christ, as recorded
in the body of the presumably authentic sayings
and parables, is to Royce profoundly unsatisfactory.
"If He had so viewed the matter, the
Messianic tragedy in which His life-work culminated
would have been needless and unintelligible."<a name="FNanchor_51_199" id="FNanchor_51_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
What is most vital in Christianity
"is contained in whatever is essential and permanent
about the doctrines of the incarnation
and atonement."<a name="FNanchor_52_200" id="FNanchor_52_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In these respects Royce shows his sympathy
with traditional Christianity as over against the
standpoint of modern liberalism. He protests in
effect, in the first place, against a "reduced"
Christianity based upon the Synoptic teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of Jesus alone, and upon this teaching only after
alleged Johannine and Pauline elements have
been cut out. Secondly, he finds that Christianity
includes doctrine as well as ethics. And,
third, he finds in Paul's teaching not a perversion
of the gospel, but a developed statement of the
central ideas of Christianity.</p>

<p>Unlike many philosophers, Royce takes an
austere view of the misery and tragedy of sin,
as "grave with the gravity of life, and stern only
as the call of life, to any awakened mind, ought
to be stern."<a name="FNanchor_53_201" id="FNanchor_53_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The sinner cannot save himself.
By his own deed he has banished himself to the
hell of the irrevocable. If there is to be atonement
which shall reconcile the traitor to his own
deed and the community to the act of treachery
against it, an atonement stated in purely human
terms, it must be an "objective" atonement, not
merely one of moral influence upon the traitor.
It must be by some creative deed of loving ingenuity
by which the world is made better than
it would have been had the treason never been
done. Thus the family of Jacob was reunited in
peculiarly tender ties after the reconciliation.
"Through Joseph's work all is made better than
it would have been had there been no treason at
all."<a name="FNanchor_54_202" id="FNanchor_54_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>In his purely human and untheological treatment
of sin and grace, Royce's thought has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
professedly moved within the limits of social relationships.
Sin is an act of broken faith or disloyalty
to the community. The sinner is restored
from his estate of misery by the saving
grace of the community.<a name="FNanchor_55_203" id="FNanchor_55_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> "'Atonement' and
'Divine Grace' may be considered as if they
were expressions of the purely human process
whereby the community seeks and saves,
through its suffering servants and its Spirit,
that which is lost."<a name="FNanchor_56_204" id="FNanchor_56_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>While Royce's exposition of sin and grace is
full of suggestion and insight, it is more philosophical
than Biblical. Thus at important points
the contrast between Paul and Royce's interpretation
of Paul is very striking. Royce hints at
the divinity of the community, while Paul asserts
the divinity of Christ. Royce says, Be loyal to
the community, while Paul would say primarily,
Believe in Christ and be loyal to Him. "Loyalty
to the personal Christ," says a reviewer of
Royce's work, "has been (and surely is) even a
more vital element in Christianity than loyalty
to the community."<a name="FNanchor_57_205" id="FNanchor_57_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Royce would say that by
the grace of the community we are saved; while
with Paul the Saviour is personal and it was the
vision of Christ, not of the community, that transformed
his life.</p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

<p>Again it is not easy to read the doctrine of the
beloved community and of the community as the
source of grace into the words or the spirit of the
teaching of Jesus. The attempt, however, is
made. In the parable of the Prodigal Son, the
voice of the father, who is "for the moment
simply the incarnation of the spirit of this community,"<a name="FNanchor_58_206" id="FNanchor_58_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
is said to be the voice of the family,
welcoming the wanderer; and the joy of the
father is the joy of the family in his return. If
this be so the father should have said, "The
family fellowship is restored," instead of saying,
"This my son was dead and is alive again."</p>

<p>Even Royce's Old Testament illustration from
the story of Joseph, where we find a grievous
betrayal and then a deed which leaves the community,
in this case the family, richer in love and
more united in heart than if the deed of betrayal
had not been done, does not support Royce's
principle that the ideal community is the saviour
and the source of atoning grace. The story to be
illustrative should have been reversed; Joseph
should have been the betrayer and destroyer of
the family life, and then the brethren unitedly
by their love and ingenuity should have won
him back.</p>

<p>How then does the loyal community which is
to be the source of grace originate? Royce
admits that it can only be by "some miracle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
grace,"<a name="FNanchor_59_207" id="FNanchor_59_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and the problem becomes acute when
we consider the origin of the historical community
of the Christian Church. The usual
view is that here a miracle of grace has happened
in the person of Jesus, the author and finisher of
loyalty, but in that case there could be no such
"simplification of the problems of Christology,"<a name="FNanchor_60_208" id="FNanchor_60_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
as Royce desires. Who, then, was the founder
of the Christian Community? It was not Paul,
for he found a community already in existence.
It was not the human Jesus, though He gave the
signal, for we cannot say that, speaking of Jesus
as an individual man, we know that He explicitly
intended to found the Christian Church.<a name="FNanchor_61_209" id="FNanchor_61_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> It was
not the divine Christ, for "the human source of
all later Christologies must be found in the early
Christian community itself."<a name="FNanchor_62_210" id="FNanchor_62_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> We must in fact
renounce our quest for the origin of the Christian
Church, for its foundation depended "upon motives
which we cannot fathom by means of any
soundings that our historical materials or our
knowledge of social psychology permit us to
make."<a name="FNanchor_63_211" id="FNanchor_63_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Such recourse to a convenient agnosticism,
however rhetorically it may be expressed,
does not bring us out of the circle, that the
church founded itself, and in that case, as a
source of grace, saves itself. The modern man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
under Royce's guidance, is relieved from the
problems of Christology only to find that those
of ecclesiology are equally pressing.</p>

<p>The conception of the community is obviously
fruitful alike in its ethical and its theological
implications, and Royce's discussion of it, so
elevated in its tone, will doubtless be for the
"strengthening of hearts" as he desires. But
inferences foreign to Christian thought are
drawn when it is suggested that "Man the community
may prove to be God,"<a name="FNanchor_64_212" id="FNanchor_64_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and that in
"this essentially social universe" the community
is "the Absolute."<a name="FNanchor_65_213" id="FNanchor_65_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> This is the voice of Hegel
rather than that of Paul.</p>

<p>In an essay on Browning's theism Royce has
remarked: "To say God is Love is, then, the
same as to say that God is, or has been, or will
be incarnate, perhaps once, perhaps&mdash;for so
Browning's always monistic intuitions about the
relation of God and the world always suggest to
him&mdash;perhaps always, perhaps in all our life,
perhaps in all men."<a name="FNanchor_66_214" id="FNanchor_66_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The doctrine of the incarnation
is thus acknowledged to be vital not
only for Christianity but for theism as well.
"The fact of the Incarnation," as Westcott has
said, "gives reality to that moral conception of
God as active Love without which Theism becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a formula."<a name="FNanchor_67_215" id="FNanchor_67_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> But the meaning of incarnation
and its support of theistic belief is
weakened in proportion as it is interpreted not
in an historical sense but as an incarnation "perhaps
always, perhaps in all men."</p>

<p>In his emphasis upon the incarnation and
atonement, Royce has shown a profound appreciation
of what is vital in Christianity, but his
discussion shows also that these doctrines themselves,
in being removed from their historic setting
and adapted to the requirements of a philosophical
theory, may easily lose what is for
religion their most vital elements.</p>

<p>Each of our four philosophers has performed
an important service for religious thought.
Bergson has made an effective protest against
materialism. Eucken has asserted the reality of
the spiritual world. Ward has strengthened the
philosophical foundations of belief in God and
immortality. Royce has found in the distinctive
ideas of Christianity the crown of religious philosophy.</p>

<p>The deeper thought of our age, judged by its
leading exponents, has been working towards
Christianity and not in the opposite direction.
It has broken away from materialism with its
denial of a spiritual world. It has broken away
from an idealism which denies personality in
God and man. It has been strongly attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to Christianity, and influenced in its intellectual
constructions by the teaching of Christ and of
the Apostles. It is at one with Christianity in
its ethical standpoint and emphasis. The Cross
is no longer foolishness to the Greek, when
leaders of philosophic thought find in Christianity
their brightest glimpse into the homeland
of the spirit, the source of their deepest
insights into truth, the inspiration of their most
fruitful activity and the key to the solution of
their profoundest problems.</p>

<h2>The Christian Faith and Other Religions</h2>


<p>Four universals were contained in the last
commands of the Risen Christ: "All
authority has been given unto me. Go,
disciple all the nations, teaching them to observe
all things that I have commanded you: and lo,
I am with you all the days." If the marching
orders of the Church were to be obeyed, the
Christian Faith must be brought into contact
and into conflict not only with Judaism but with
all the ethnic faiths. If its program is to be
carried out successfully, Christianity must supersede
all other religions. In this lecture we must
consider the relation of Christianity to ancient
religions, or those prevalent in the Roman Empire
at the time of its founding, and then its relation
to modern religions.</p>

<br>
<p>I. <span class="smcap">Christianity and Ancient Religions</span></p>

<p>That the religion of the cross, which started in
a despised and persecuted sect among a people
without intellectual or military prestige, should
in three centuries become the state religion of
the Roman Empire, is often spoken of as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
miracle of history. The early missionary could
not appeal to military force or to an obviously
superior type of civilization, and the wonder is
not that Christianity conquered the Roman
world but that it ever secured a foothold at all.
The familiar argument has been: "We can
account for the progress of Christianity, against
obstacles and without outward aids, only upon
the assumption that a divine power was working
within."</p>

<p>Since the rise of the "religious-historical
school" in Germany some dozen years ago, the
question of Christianity's relation to contemporary
religions has come up in a new form, and
has been brought into the foreground of theological
discussion. The victory of early Christianity,
it is asserted, is due to the fact that Paul
not merely presented it to the Romans in a
juridical form, but that he preached the myth or
mystery of a dying and rising Saviour to the
myth loving Greeks; and it is even said that the
New Testament portrait of Christ, whatever
historical reality lies behind it, is in fact a sort
of glorified composite photograph made out of
the elements of a Jewish Messiah, a Greek Apollo
or Adonis and an Egyptian Osiris. The claim
is made by the more extreme members of the
"religious-historical school" that every feature
of Christianity that was supposed to be original,
and indeed practically the whole Gospel narrative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
can be parallelled closely or remotely in
Persian, Hindu, Syrian, Egyptian or Greek religious
literature, or in the Old Testament and
the teaching of the philosophers.</p>

<p>The reasons for Christianity's triumph over
other religions may be still to seek, but its claim
to supernatural authority is called in question
by the recent movement in scholarship which
has taken as its motto, The study of the Christian
Faith in the light of the history of religions.
"It would be strange indeed," a writer has remarked,
"if such parallels did not raise new
questionings in the place of old certainties. If
the accounts of miraculous births and resurrections
are plainly fabulous when we meet with
them in other faiths, are they necessarily historical
when they occur in the Christian Scriptures?
At any rate we feel that stringent evidence
will be required to prove them so."<a name="FNanchor_1_216" id="FNanchor_1_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>When we study the relation between early
Christianity and the religions of the time it is
clear that some established principles are needed
to control the comparison. When it is discovered,
for instance, that Confucius had seventy-two
disciples and an inner circle of ten "select
ones," and that he spoke the Golden Rule in a
negative form, does it follow that the Gospel accounts
of the choice of the twelve and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
seventy were borrowed from Confucius?
Clemen's formulation of the principles that must
govern the comparison will be generally accepted:</p>

<p>(1) "A religious-historical explanation is impossible
if it leads to untenable consequences
or proceeds from untenable presuppositions.
(2) The sense of the New Testament passage, as
well as the contents of the non-Jewish idea, must
first be fully ascertained. (3) We ought never
to assume that ideas of an advanced religion
have been altogether borrowed, until we have
done our best to discover any germs of them in
the native religious literature. (4) The non-Jewish
idea that is brought in as an explanation
must really in some degree correspond to the
Christian one. (5) This element must have
been already in existence: an idea that is subsequent
in its emergence cannot, of course, have
given rise to one previously existent. (6) It
must be shown in regard to any foreign idea
that it was really in a position to influence Christianity,
or Judaism before it, and how."<a name="FNanchor_2_217" id="FNanchor_2_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> To
these might be added that the possibility of coincidence
must not be overlooked.</p>

<p>With these principles, most of them self-evident,
in our minds, let us glance at the topics of
immediate interest in our present field: (1) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Virgin Birth and its parallels; (2) the worship of
Christ and the Emperor-cult; and (3) Christianity
and the Mystery Religions.</p>

<p>1. In its relation to the stories of current
mythology, the Virgin Birth was a subject of
active discussion in the time of the fathers. The
patristic apologists make two points in referring
to the mythological parallels. On the one hand,
the similarity of the Gospel story in its supernatural
element to the stories prevalent at the time
is appealed to in order to commend it to the acceptance
of the Greeks. Thus Justin says:
"We propound nothing different from what you
believe regarding those whom you esteem sons
of Jupiter."<a name="FNanchor_3_218" id="FNanchor_3_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Similarly Origen says: "There is
no absurdity in employing Grecian histories to
answer Greeks with a view to showing that we
are not the only persons who have recourse to
miraculous narratives of this kind."<a name="FNanchor_4_219" id="FNanchor_4_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> On the
other hand, the difference between the Christian
and the heathen stories is appealed to as proof
of the moral and historical superiority of the
Gospel narratives. Justin says that the Virgin
conceived "not by intercourse but by power;"<a name="FNanchor_5_220" id="FNanchor_5_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
and Origen, referring to a tradition about the
birth of Plato, says that such stories are "veritable
fables."<a name="FNanchor_6_221" id="FNanchor_6_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The notion is popular to-day that stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the birth of a god or a hero from a virgin are
common in non-Christian religions, and the remark
is heard that the Virgin Birth of Jesus
would be credible were it not for these parallels.
A closer examination shows, however, that while
supernatural births were the common property
of most ancient religions, the Virgin Birth was a
distinctive and spontaneous feature of Christianity.
Thus Clemen remarks that "what we
find in Indian thought (at any rate in earlier
times) is not a Virgin Birth in the proper sense
of that term, but only a miraculous birth, and
one of quite a different type from the birth of
Jesus."<a name="FNanchor_7_222" id="FNanchor_7_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Alluding to the fact that Buddhism
was so entirely outside the western range of
vision as to be noticed very meagrely in the
Greek and Roman literature, Clemen says that
"if there are similarities that cannot be accidental
between this later Buddhistic literature
and the New Testament, the question would arise
whether the former could not be dependent upon
the latter,"<a name="FNanchor_8_223" id="FNanchor_8_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> since Christianity penetrated early
to India.</p>

<p>Clemen quotes Franckh to the effect that "none
of these personages that play the part of a
mother-goddess is thought of as a virgin. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
only in the course of time that Ishtar is everywhere
put in the place of the earlier mother-goddesses....
As mother-goddess, Ishtar has
no male god who permanently corresponds to
her. This is the reason why she is vaguely
spoken of as the 'virgin' Ishtar. But it must
be emphatically asserted that here the idea of
virginity undergoes a vague deflection."<a name="FNanchor_9_224" id="FNanchor_9_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Of the parallels adduced, only two are clearly
cases of birth from a virgin: Simon Magus
(<i>Clem. Recog.</i> II, 14) and a certain Terebinthus
(<i>Acta Archelai et Manetis</i>, c. 52), both of whom
claimed to be born from a virgin; but, as Grützmacher
remarks, these stories arose under Christian
influences and are found in post-Christian
writings so that they are not the root but the
product of the Gospel narratives;<a name="FNanchor_10_225" id="FNanchor_10_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and E. Petersen
admits that in these cases there may be a simple
taking over of the supernatural birth of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_11_226" id="FNanchor_11_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>In the Græco-Roman myths there is always
some fleshly or sensible medium. Both the essential
difference in the Gospel narratives, and
the lack of any proved avenue of influence leading
to these narratives, with their strongly Jewish
colouring, from heathen sources, makes the
theory of derivation from these sources most
improbable.</p>

<p>2. The famous Priene inscription, dated about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the year 9 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, has shown that the titles given
to the Emperor Augustus were strikingly similar
to those addressed by Christians to Christ. The
day of the Emperor's birth was of great significance
for the human race; he is called Saviour
of men, he is to abolish war and bring general
happiness; and the inscription declares that "the
birthday of the god was for the world the beginning
of tidings of joy on his account."<a name="FNanchor_12_227" id="FNanchor_12_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Both religions again, the worship of Christ and
the Emperor-cult, were universal religions, the
essential difference being that the former excluded,
while the latter tolerated, other forms of
worship. Did the Christian Church derive its
worship of Christ as Lord, or even such titles
as "Saviour" and "Lord," from the Emperor-worship
of the time?</p>

<p>The deification of a king was by no means an
unfamiliar thing in the ancient and especially in
the oriental world. The kings of Egypt are said
to have worshipped themselves. To the offer of
Alexander the Great to rebuild the burnt temple of
Diana at Ephesus, the shrewd reply of the priests,
not wishing to offend either Persia or Greece, was
that it was not fitting for one deity to build the
temple of another. The ascription of divine
honours to the Emperor was a victory of eastern
influences over Roman thought. Emperor worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was (1) a compliment to the ruler; (2) a
kind of personification of the genius of the Empire,
as perhaps in the case of the Mikado to-day;
and (3) a convenient neutral religion, since
no existing cult could be universal, binding all
peoples together in a necessary religious bond.
While not taken very seriously by the astute
rulers themselves, it may also have been to many
minds "an actual breaking out of religious longing,"
such as seems to be expressed in Vergil's
"Fourth Eclogue," for a heaven-sent deliverer
and saviour.</p>

<p>To Jews and Christians alike, however, the idea
of the worship of the Emperor was in the highest
degree abhorrent. This is shown by the fierce opposition
to the setting up of the statue of Caligula
in the Temple, by the refusal of the early Christians
to worship the genius of the Cæsars under
pain of death, and by the parallel accounts in the
Acts and Josephus of the death of Herod, both
Jewish and Christian authors describing his sudden
death as a judgment upon his impiety in accepting
divine honours. With Paul the "setting
himself forth as God" was a mark of the man of
sin (2 Thess. ii. 3, 4). It is then improbable in
the highest degree that an idea so repellent alike
to Jewish and Christian thought could have been
in any way responsible for the worship of Christ
as divine.</p>

<p>But was it not possible that such titles as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
"Lord" and "Saviour" should on Gentile soil
have been unconsciously taken over by the
Christians, suggested to them by the growing
use of these terms as addressed to the Emperor
and their free ascription to heathen deities?
This position has been defended by Bousset,
who says that "it was in the air that the first
Hellenistic Christian community should give to
its cult-hero the title Kyrios (Lord)."<a name="FNanchor_13_228" id="FNanchor_13_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Even
this theory of an unconscious verbal influence
exerted on Gentile soil is full of difficulty. To
maintain that the title "Lord" originated in
the Gentile-Christian church it is necessary, of
course, to discard the evidence of all the documents,
the Gospels, the Acts and the Epistles.
It must be denied that Jesus called Himself
Lord, or that the title was given Him in the
Jerusalem church. Doubt must be thrown upon
the whole record of the apostolic days in the
Acts; and the evidence, in Paul's allusion to
"James, the Lord's brother" (Gal. i. 19), of the
use of the title in the Jerusalem church must be
ignored.</p>

<p>Bousset's theory is that Paul did not originate
the title but found it already in use by the Gentile
church. But there is no evidence that at the
time of Paul's conversion there was any church
on Gentile soil that was not composed, in the
main, of former Jews and of Jews who had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
from Jerusalem. When it is said that "between
Paul and the primitive church of Palestine stand
the Hellenistic churches in Antioch, Damascus,
Tarsus,"<a name="FNanchor_14_229" id="FNanchor_14_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> it must be remembered that the church
at Damascus was composed primarily of Jerusalem
Christians who were persecuted to foreign
cities; that the church at Antioch was founded
by those from Judea, and grew under the leadership
of Barnabas, a priest and leader of the Jerusalem
church (Acts xi. 19 f.; Gal. ii. 1, 12); and
that there is no evidence that there were any
Christians at Tarsus until the time of Paul's visit
(Acts ix. 30; Gal. i. 21). It is hard to see how
there can be any question of an entirely new title
spontaneously arising from the heathen environment,
and free from the influence of the church
at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>If it be asked how Jews could dare to apply
the name Kyrios, "the holy cult-name of the
Old Testament Jahwe," to Jesus, the answer is
suggested by Bousset himself when he says:
"Therein lay a piece of monotheistic feeling:
God alone should be prayed to and worshipped.
This powerful religious feeling, free from all reflection,
has once and again in the history of
Christological dogma asserted itself."<a name="FNanchor_15_230" id="FNanchor_15_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The essence
of the matter is that Christian converts
both Jewish and Gentile called upon the name
of the Lord, and worshipped Him; but it is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that Jesus was first worshipped on Jewish
soil as King of Israel, and Lord in the sense
made familiar in the Old Testament (Rom. x.
9-13; Acts ii. 17, 21), before He was worshipped
on Gentile soil as King of Kings and
Lord of Lords.</p>

<p>Aside from all else it is highly improbable that
in the time of Paul's conversion the use of the
title Lord (Kyrios, Dominus) as applied to the
Emperor was so wide-spread as to have exercised
any appreciable influence upon Christianity.
"It would after all," Bousset himself
acknowledges, "in spite of all analogies in substance
and words, be an erroneous and over-hasty
inference, were we to bring the Christian
Kyrios-cult and its origin into immediate connection
with the cult of the Cæsars. In the time
and in the regions in which the Kyrios-Jesus cult
arose, the worship of the ruler scarcely as yet
had possessed so dominating a rôle that the
worship of Jesus as Lord must be regarded as
having arisen in conscious opposition to it."<a name="FNanchor_16_231" id="FNanchor_16_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The conscious opposition no doubt came later,
as Deissmann has suggested, when the cult of
the Christ went forth into the Roman world and
endeavoured to reserve for itself words which
had just been transferred to the deified emperors,
or had been invented for that worship. "Thus
there arises," he says, "a polemical parallelism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
between the cult of the emperor and the cult of
Christ, which makes itself felt where ancient
words derived by Christianity from the treasury
of the Septuagint and the Gospels happen to
coincide with solemn concepts of the Imperial
cult which sounded the same or similar."<a name="FNanchor_17_232" id="FNanchor_17_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> It
was inevitable that, as Paul preached Jesus Christ
as Lord, the contrast between the Christian worship
and the worship of the Cæsars should suggest
itself, together with their irreconcilable
antagonism. This "polemical parallelism" is
probably expressed in such titles as "our only
Master and Lord" (Jude 4), "Every tongue
shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord" (Phil.
ii. 11), and "King of Kings and Lord of Lords"
(Rev. xix. 16).</p>

<p>3. The relation of Paul to the Mystery Religions
of his time is a topic which has of late
been actively discussed. A thesis now widely
maintained has been expressed by Loisy in an
epigrammatic form: "The mystery of Paul's
conversion is his conversion to the mysteries."
To discuss the question in all its bearings, one
would need a general acquaintance with classical
literature, a special knowledge of religious conditions
in the early Roman Empire, and, most
important of all, a first-hand exegetical knowledge
of Paul's epistles.</p>

<p>A marked feature of the age in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Apostle lived was a merging of deities, and the
practice of oriental cults side by side with the
official Roman religion and the worship of the
Cæsar. This syncretism was promoted by the
tolerance of an official religious indifferentism,
and by a pantheistic philosophy which was hospitable
to the worship of a multiplicity of deities as
aspects of the One and the All. At a time when
the Orontes was pouring its waters into the Tiber,
the mysteries of the oriental religions were actively
propagated in the West and coalesced
with the mysteries practiced among the Greeks.</p>

<p>In spite of the labours of philologists and
archæologists, our knowledge of the ritual of
the various mysteries and even of the ideas
symbolized is comparatively slight. It can still
be said with Cumont that, "shut out from the
sanctuary like profane outsiders, we hear only
the indistinct echo of the sacred songs and not
even in imagination can we attend the celebration
of the mysteries."<a name="FNanchor_18_233" id="FNanchor_18_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The moral effect of the mystery cults is also a
matter of some doubt. Plato, as we know (<i>Phædo</i>,
69 D, 81 A), had a high opinion of the Greek
mysteries; but the cruel and sensual rites of the
oriental religions scandalized the Latin writers as
well as the Christian apologists. Even Cumont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
who thinks that the mystery cults were superior
in their religious appeal and influence to the cold,
prosaic and austere Roman religion, admits that
by the adoption of the mysteries "barbarous,
cruel and obscene practices were undoubtedly
spread."<a name="FNanchor_19_234" id="FNanchor_19_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> It is evident that the oriental religions
became spiritualized in course of time, and that the
various deities at least of Egypt and of Syria came
to be conceived, in accordance with the dominant
philosophy, in a henotheistic or pantheistic way.
Uhlhorn thinks that oriental worship "with all its
distortions was more profound, and contained unconscious
presages of the Deity who has indeed
in birth and death descended to redeem us."<a name="FNanchor_20_235" id="FNanchor_20_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>When Paul preached "the mystery of God
which is Christ" (Col. ii. 2), he incorporated into
Christianity, it is said, in adapting it to the Gentile
world, features which were common to the
mystery brotherhoods of the day, and virtually
transformed it into a mystery religion. Pauline
Christianity, say the extreme advocates of this
view, adopted its vocabulary, its missionary methods,
its philosophical and religious ideas, its sacraments
and symbolism, its mystical experiences
and even its organization, from the compound of
oriental mysticism and Greek philosophy which
was popular in the cities which Paul visited.</p>

<p>The points in dispute will appear if we glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the Pauline doctrine of the sacraments, and of
dying and rising with Christ, and then at the
Pauline vocabulary.</p>

<p>That the ritual of the mysteries had something in
common with the Christian sacraments is shown
by the fact that the charge of borrowing was
made from both sides in early times. The Christian
writers accuse the heathen priests of a blasphemous
parody of the Christian sacraments inspired
by the spirit of lies, and the priests retorted
that the sacraments were a plagiarism from the
mysteries. Cumont believes that both were much
mistaken.</p>

<p>The material for comparison is somewhat meagre
because baptism is not prominent in Paul's
epistles. He never mentions his own baptism,
and, aside from I Corinthians i., in which he says
that he was not sent to baptize, he uses the verb
in but four passages (I Cor. x. 2; xii. 13; xv. 29;
Gal. iii. 27); the noun in two (Eph. iv. 5; Col.
ii. 12); and both verb and noun in one passage
(Rom. vi. 3-4). In the mysteries there were lustrations
with salt water, water of the Nile and sacred
water, but little is known of the exact significance
of the rituals. Kennedy is not persuaded
that it meant regeneration.<a name="FNanchor_21_236" id="FNanchor_21_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> There was no baptizing
"in the name of" the gods.</p>

<p>On the other hand we know little of any sacrificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
meal in the mysteries corresponding to the
Eucharist. Reitzenstein observes that unless a
happy chance sheds more light upon the use and
meaning of the mystery-meals common in most
cults, a comparison with the sacraments remains
only "a play with possibilities."<a name="FNanchor_22_237" id="FNanchor_22_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Clemen thinks
that both the institution of the Lord's Supper
by Jesus and its continued observance are
fully explained without bringing in foreign influences.<a name="FNanchor_23_238" id="FNanchor_23_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the mystery cults exerted an
influence upon the later development of sacramental
doctrine, but this is aside from our question.
Thus Wendt would place the influence of
the mystery religions upon the Christian sacraments
in the post-Pauline age, and thinks that
"to Acts we owe the undoubtedly correct tradition
that these Christian rites go back to a date
preceding the Hellenistic mission of Paul, and
must be sought for in the very earliest practice
of the Apostolic community."<a name="FNanchor_24_239" id="FNanchor_24_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Hatch also believes
that between apostolic and post-apostolic
times the sacraments were modified in important
respects under the influence of the mysteries.
"The primitive 'see here is water, what doth
hinder me to be baptized?' passed into a ritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
which at every turn recalls the ritual of the mysteries."<a name="FNanchor_25_240" id="FNanchor_25_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Those who push back the influence of the mysteries
upon the sacraments to the teaching of
Paul himself are compelled to interpret the Apostle's
language, contrary, we believe, to the best
exegetical tradition, in a physical or what is called
an <i>ex opere operato</i> sense. It is significant that
when the sacraments are so interpreted they appear
to be a foreign element in Paul's system.
"It is no wonder that interpreters like Heitmüller
and Weinel, who attribute a magical view of the
sacraments to Paul, are concerned to point out
that his sacramentalism is a sort of erratic boulder
in his system as a whole."<a name="FNanchor_26_241" id="FNanchor_26_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> We are reminded
of Clemen's principle that the sense of the New
Testament passage should be fully ascertained
before dependence is assumed.</p>

<p>When von Dobschütz says that "the unique
sacramental conception of the Early Church,
which has no analogy in the history of religion
because it belongs essentially to the Christian
religion, has its origin solely in Christian faith
and Christian experience,"<a name="FNanchor_27_242" id="FNanchor_27_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> the same may be
said of Paul's doctrine of dying and rising again
with Christ. When Paul says "buried with him
in baptism" (Rom. vi. 4 and Col. ii. 12), he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
speaks of no pantheistic or magical union with
the deity such as seemed to dominate the
thought of the mysteries, so far as their meaning
can be ascertained. In both contexts Paul
immediately goes on to exhortation. "Let not
sin reign" (Rom. vi. 12), "Seek the things
above; mortify your members" (Col. iii. 1-5).
It should further be noticed that the passage
most relied upon to prove Paul's borrowing
from the mysteries (Rom. vi.) was addressed to
a church which Paul did not found, composed of
both Jewish and Gentile Christians. The doctrine
in question was not put forth as a novelty,
but is assumed to be known to them: "Are ye
ignorant, etc.?" (Rom. vi. 3).</p>

<p>Paul's doctrine of dying and rising with Christ
is ethical rather than "metaphysical" or magical
or sacramental. It is surprising to find how little
sacramental it is. With no allusion to his own
baptism or to the Lord's Supper he says, "I have
been crucified with Christ. The world is crucified
to me and I to the world" (Gal. ii. 20; vi. 14).
"Christ died for all, therefore all died" (2 Cor.
v. 14). "To know Christ, to be found in him,
to be transformed into his death" (Phil. iii. 8 f.).
His doctrine is based upon a personal experience
of grace, and this is associated with the
Cross rather than with the sacraments. The
bond which mediated his union with Christ in
His death was faith. It was through faith that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the Spirit is to be received (Gal. iii. 14), and even
when he says, "Christ liveth in me," he adds,
"I live in the faith of the Son of God" (Gal.
ii. 20, and see Eph. iii. 17). He would gain
Christ that he might have "the righteousness of
God through faith" (Phil. iii. 9). The Cross and
not the sacraments was central alike in the
Apostle's experience and in his doctrine of dying
and rising with Christ, and the bond of union
between him and Christ was faith. There was
no mystical absorption of personality as in the
Hermetic prayers: "Thou art I, and I am thou."</p>

<p>Finally the Pauline mystery was distinguished
from the heathen mysteries by its connection
with an historical Person. In the Pauline mystery,
it has been said, the divine appeared in a
"concrete and comprehensible guise," and "this
connection of a religious principle with a Person
who had walked upon earth and suffered death
was a phenomenon of singular power and originality."<a name="FNanchor_28_243" id="FNanchor_28_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
There is a world of difference between
the nature-myths, underlying the mysteries, of
the annually dying and rising vegetation gods,
without historical reality, and promising to the
initiated release from transitoriness and mortality,
and the record of Christ who died for our
sins, and who being raised from the dead dieth
no more. To say that Paul not only conformed
the Lord's Supper to the heathen mysteries, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
invented it in imitation of the mysteries, is to accuse
him of deliberate misstatement; for in a
passage of unusual solemnity (I Cor. xi. 23 ff.),
he says that he received it of the Lord, and relates
the circumstances of the institution of the
Supper by Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>The argument from vocabulary is relied upon
by Reitzenstein to prove the influence of heathen
ideas upon the thought of the Apostle. It is his
theory that Paul spent the two years of inner
disturbance, in part at least, in the study of Hellenistic
religion and philosophy, and that this influence
helped him in the construction of a new
religion. In substance Reitzenstein's argument
is that Paul shows the use of technical religious
terms found in the Hermetic writings, especially
in the "Poimandres"; and that the "Poimandres"
is to be dated earlier than the "Shepherd" of
Hermas; and that the conceptions it embodies
were current in the Roman Empire, and in a literary
form, in the time of Paul. The argument
is twofold, first, that the Hermetic writings were
current in the time of Paul, and, second, that
Paul shows their influence in his vocabulary.
As the date of the "Poimandres," the most important
of the Hermetic writings, is in dispute,
the latter point may be considered first.</p>

<p>In the Pauline vocabulary Reitzenstein believes
that we have "an absolutely certain proof
of the immediate influence of Hellenism upon<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
the Apostle, and at the same time a measure of
its strength."<a name="FNanchor_29_244" id="FNanchor_29_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> "Only when the existence and
meaning of a religious literature in Hellenism is
assured and the sort of linguistic dependence is
seen to depend on literary mediation is the opportunity
of an explanation afforded."<a name="FNanchor_30_245" id="FNanchor_30_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Many
words thought to be characteristically Pauline
are said to have been technical terms in the
popular mystery cults of the day, before the
Apostle adopted them as the expression of his
own religious teaching.</p>

<p>Without attempting to follow the argument in
detail, we may observe (<i>a</i>) that Paul uses many
of these terms in a different sense from that of
the Hermetic literature. Compare, for example,
Paul's use of familiar words such as "salvation,"
"glory," "grace," with that of the Magic Papyri.
In "Hermes-Prayer I," the petition is for "health,
salvation, prosperity, glory, victory, power, loveliness."<a name="FNanchor_31_246" id="FNanchor_31_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
So in "Prayer II," "Give me grace,
food, victory, good luck, loveliness, etc."<a name="FNanchor_32_247" id="FNanchor_32_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
Again in "Hermes-Prayer III," we read, "Save
me always from drugs and deceit, and all witchcraft
and evil tongues and all trouble, from all
hate both of Gods and men. Give me grace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
victory and business and success; for Thou art
I, and I am Thou.... I am thy image."<a name="FNanchor_33_248" id="FNanchor_33_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
In these prayers from the later Hermes-Thot
religion, the Pauline terms are evidently used in
a worldly sense, contrasting strongly with their
use by Paul.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Much of the technical phraseology common
to Paul and the Hermetic literature is
current in the Old Testament; and with the
language of the Old Testament we know that
Paul's mind was saturated. Clemen's maxim
should be observed, and we should seek the
source of an idea (or word) in the native religion
before going farther afield. Thus before Paul's
doctrine of the Spirit is assigned with confidence
to Hellenistic sources, the use of the term Spirit
both in the Old Testament and in pre-Pauline
Christianity should be studied. Paul quotes the
passage from Joel which promises the outpouring
of the Spirit (Rom. x. 13 f.; see Acts ii. 21). He
brings the Spirit into connection with the blessing
of Abraham (Gal. iii. 14). The Spirit is also
mentioned in the introduction to the ministry of
Jesus alike by Mark and by the non-Markan
source. A sufficient and natural explanation of
Paul's doctrine of the Spirit is to be found in the
Old Testament, in Evangelical tradition and in
the experience of the church at Pentecost, and in
his own experience. When Paul speaks of "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba,
Father'" (Rom. viii. 15; Gal. iv. 6), we have to
do not with remote literary influences nor with
the dry bones of any technical theology, Hebraic
or Hermetic, but with the heart-throb of personal
experience.</p>

<p>Reitzenstein believes that the Pauline vocabulary
is best explained by the Hellenistic parallels,
but he recognizes that the parallelism with the
Old Testament should be considered. Thus
while he thinks that he has shown parallels for
all the Pauline uses of the word <i>pneuma</i>, he says
"whether with equal ease all may be explained
from the Hebraic use of <i>ruach</i> and <i>nephesh</i> or
the use of <i>pneuma</i> in the Septuagint the theologian
must decide."<a name="FNanchor_34_249" id="FNanchor_34_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Harnack, with some
irony, advises Reitzenstein and his school to gain
a clearer knowledge of Paul the Jew and Paul
the Christian before they take account of secondary
elements which he borrowed from the
Greek mysteries. A conscious acceptance, he
thinks, of such elements is out of the question.<a name="FNanchor_35_250" id="FNanchor_35_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>

<p>If the Hermetic writings are to be dated later
than the time of Paul, then the question of
literary influence is reversed. Similarity in
words will then be due to coincidence or to the
prevalence of a common religious vocabulary, or
else, as has recently been said, "if it is necessary
to suppose literary connection, the artificial
literary composition of 'Poimandres' makes it
more probable that the borrowing was on that
side."<a name="FNanchor_36_251" id="FNanchor_36_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The question hinges upon the date of
the "Poimandres," which it has been usual, at
least since the middle of the seventeenth century,
to assign to the age of Porphyry. Hermes has
been regarded as "a convenient pseudonym to
place at the head of the numerous syncretic
writings in which it was sought to combine Neo-Platonic
philosophy, Philonic Judaism and cabalistic
theosophy, and so provide the world with
some acceptable substitute for Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_37_252" id="FNanchor_37_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>By a brilliant <i>tour de force</i> and with great
learning Reitzenstein has sought to reverse this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
relationship, and to show that the original form
of these writings, or at least the fixed religious
ideas, vocabulary and ritual which they presuppose,
antedated Pauline Christianity and
profoundly influenced the writings of Paul and
of John. He argues that the "Shepherd" of
Hermas is dependent upon the "Poimandres," relying
mainly upon two points: the similarity between
the two writings in their introductions, and
the fact that in the "Shepherd" the divine messenger
appears on a mountain, Arcadia, which
was the alleged birthplace of Hermes and a
centre of the Hermes cult. The significant
points of the introduction may thus be shown:</p>

<p>The decisive thing in the comparison is said<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>
to be not the change of form nor the assurance
that the revealing spirit would always be with
the prophet, "but that he revealed himself, to
the heathen as the Shepherd of men (<i>Menschenhirten</i>),
to the Christian as the Shepherd of this
man."<a name="FNanchor_39_254" id="FNanchor_39_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The comparison leads Reitzenstein to
the twofold conclusion that the "Shepherd" of
Hermas has taken over awkwardly a type foreign
to Christian revelation literature, and that "the
Christian borrowed that description of the shepherd
from an originally fuller text."<a name="FNanchor_40_255" id="FNanchor_40_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>The argument for borrowing is obviously
weakened by the admission that Hermas did not
borrow from the extant "Poimandres" but from
an assumed earlier form of the text; and, further,
it is by no means clear why the figure of the
shepherd, familiar in the Old Testament and in
the Gospel parables, should be a foreign type in
Christian literature. Nor is the case materially
strengthened by the argument that a later mention
of a mountain in Arcadia, in the "Shepherd,"
implies an acquaintance with the "Poimandres"
where no mention of Arcadia, but simply of descent
from a mountain, is made. It is admitted
that the leading up upon a mountain
is a current form of Christian literature, but it
is said that "the exact choice of Arcadia is
more than surprising, since the author lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Rome, and besides saw his visions at Rome or
Cumæ."<a name="FNanchor_41_256" id="FNanchor_41_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>It seems unnecessary to guess with Zahn that
"Arikia" should be read instead of "Arkadia,"
or to assume that Hermas was a native of Arcadia,
or had a book of travels in his hands, or
that he was thinking of Hermes or the Hermetic
writings. The literary tradition connecting Arcadia
with shepherds and with pastoral poetry
was in itself enough, as Vergil's "Eclogues"
may suggest. It is admitted that Hermas was
a literary man even if "a man of the people,"
and what more natural place for a shepherd to
appear, if it was to be upon a mountain, than
a mountain in Arcadia? Shepherds have suggested
Arcadia from the time of Vergil to that of
Sir Philip Sydney, and Vergil, in breaking away
from the Sicily of Theocritus, was quite probably
following a tradition already established at Rome.</p>

<p>An historian of Roman religion, W. Warde
Fowler, says of Christianity as preached by Paul
that "the plant, though grown in a soil which had
borne other crops, was wholly new in structure
and vital principle. I say this deliberately, after
spending so many years on the study of the
religion of the Romans, and making myself acquainted
in some measure with the religions of
other peoples. The love of Christ is the entirely
new power that has come into the world; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
merely as a new type of morality, but as 'a Divine
influence transfiguring human nature in a
universal love.' The passion of St. Paul's appeal
lies in the consecration of every detail of it by
reference to the life and death of the Master."<a name="FNanchor_42_257" id="FNanchor_42_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The gospel which conquered the Roman Empire
was no syncretic product growing from
Græco-Roman soil, no <i>mélange</i> of oriental religions
and Greek philosophy, no cunningly devised
fable or myth for the myth-loving Greeks. No
explanation of the character of Pauline Christianity,
or of its victory over its rivals in the
ancient world, can ignore the statements of Paul
himself: "When the fulness of time was come,
God sent forth his Son; he revealed his Son in
me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles"
(Gal. iv. 4; i. 16).</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Christianity and Modern Religions</span></p>

<p>The relation of Christianity to modern religions
is a matter of practical rather than theoretical
interest. After the brilliant victories of
the early missionary age, the activity of the
church in spreading the gospel among the non-Christian
peoples was for many centuries remitted,
and it is only practically within the last
one hundred years that the Christian Faith has
been brought into actual contact, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
work of its missionaries, with the non-Christian
religions.</p>

<p>Through its missionary propaganda Christianity
has shown its genuineness and its devotion
to the commands of its Founder; and so far as
it has proved its ability to meet the religious
needs and quicken the religious and intellectual
life of diverse nationalities, it has supplied a
practical demonstration of its divine origin and
authority. The missionaries have supplied the
church with a pattern of apostolic zeal, and have
kept burning the fire of a passionate love and
devotion for their Master. A British statesman
has said that the unselfish imperialism of its
missionary propaganda has been the crowning
glory of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>While the unceasing struggle of Christianity
against worldliness, greed, indifference and unbelief
still continues, it may be said that Christianity
has to-day no rival as a claimant to be the
universal religion. It alone can stand the white
light of modern science, and it alone can stand
the test of those moral ideals which have been
largely created by itself. It is absolutely certain
that none of the present ethnic religions can
compete with Christianity in its contest for world
supremacy.</p>

<p>The great danger to Christianity to-day, from
the side of other religions, is not that of persecution
or the hostility of the state. The danger lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
in the temptation to compromise. Let Christianity,
it is said, lay aside its assumption of divine
and exclusive authority and of infinite superiority
to all other religions, and let it make in its ethics
some concessions to the weakness of human
nature, and the path to world-conquest will be
open.</p>

<p>Never was the temptation to compromise, with
Judaism on the one hand and heathenism on the
other, stronger than it was in the early ages of
the Christian Church. If Christianity had compromised
in the time of Jesus and Paul, persecution
would have ceased and the scandal of the
cross would have been removed. If early Christianity
had compromised with heathenism, and
had not waged unrelenting warfare upon idolatry,
it could have escaped the united hostility
of the state and of the other religions and philosophies;
on the other hand, if Christianity had
come to terms with Judaism or Paganism, while
it might perhaps be known historically as an obscure
Jewish sect, or as a ripple upon the wave
of oriental religious influence upon the Græco-Roman
world, it would never have been the
mighty spiritual power that it has been in human
society.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to-day to think that for Christianity
the way of conquest is the way of compromise,
and that Christianity can become a
world religion, superseding all others, by laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
aside its distinctive features and its exalted and
exclusive claims. It would, indeed, be a mistake
to import our doctrinal systems in all their controversial
details into the heathen world, and the
mystical oriental mind may easily clothe Christianity,
itself an oriental religion, in new and
more beautiful forms; but it would be, if possible,
a greater mistake to attempt to substitute
ethics or natural religion for doctrinal Christianity.</p>

<p>The rock of Islam will not yield to the preaching
of a merely human and prophetic Jesus; nor
will the preaching of the Fatherhood of God and
the Brotherhood of man&mdash;the same message
which the Swamis and Babists, with a more
pantheistic content to their message, preach in
England and America&mdash;be effective to overthrow
the hoary superstitions of India and the caste
system with its hold upon every fibre of human
nature.</p>

<p>A prominent educator and leader of thought
has recently complained that Christianity as
usually preached in foreign lands is unsuitable
to the oriental mind. On the other hand, he
chides the members of his own religious communion
because they, "with magnificent ideals,
with glorious concepts, with the truth of Christ
in all its purity and simplicity, sit in smug content
offering the world of missions, in the hour
of its hunger, only the dry bones of criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
those who already serve."<a name="FNanchor_43_258" id="FNanchor_43_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> But every practical
movement, enlisting great masses of men and
demanding tremendous sacrifice for its accomplishment,
must have a rational basis. A humanitarian
impulse is not sufficient to carry
through to a conclusion so vast and world-embracing
a plan as is contemplated by Christian
Missions. The impulse however strong and
noble will evaporate, unless based upon and fed
by a theory of what the Christian religion is, of
what it offers to men, of man's need of it, and of
the obligation of Christians to carry it to the
non-Christian nations. The history of missions
has shown that no mere feeling of benevolence
or desire to better social and economic conditions,
but the command of Christ, love for Christ
and gratitude to Christ has led the army of missionaries
to endure separation, hardship, persecution
and death.</p>

<p>Lowell has said that every new edition of an
Elizabethan dramatist "is but the putting of
another witness into the box to prove the inaccessibility
of Shakespeare's standpoint as poet
and artist." Every comparison of Christianity
with other religions, ancient and modern, brings
its own superiority into stronger relief. In Jesus
Christ and in Him alone have been fulfilled the
great religious ideas of the race. In Him as
prophet God's word is perfectly spoken, and He<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>
is the example who leads in the way of His own
precepts. In Him are fulfilled the ideas of sacrifice
and priesthood; He is the great High Priest,
separate from sinners in His holiness, but near
them in His compassion and mercy. He has
put away sin and put away sacrifice by the offering
of Himself once for all, and has destroyed
the whole sacrificial system of Jews and Gentiles.
He is the fulfillment of the idea of incarnation,
of God coming to man and of the Most High
visiting the children of men, for their rescue
from all danger and the supply of all their
needs.</p>

<p>In other religious and philosophical systems
there have been golden maxims for the conduct
of life, wonderful insights into truth and visions
of beauty, and evidences of the reaching out of
the human soul after God; but Christianity is
the only religion of which the enlightened reason
and conscience of the world can say that it is
from heaven and not from men. In no other
religion has there been a long period of centuries
of preparation in the religious education
of a people to be the recipients and the messengers,
in the fullness of time, of the final revelation.
In no other religion is there found a
teaching so profound, and yet so simple and
self-evidencing, upon the great themes of human
interest, God, Immortality and Duty. From no
other has gone forth an influence so beneficent<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>
and transforming in human history. In no other
has there been a Calvary and an Easter Day,
the great historic facts upon which the hopes of
the world rest, and in no other has the undiscovered
country been transformed into "the
Father's house."</p>

<h2>The Christian Faith and Biblical Criticism</h2>


<p>We are living at a time when territory
formerly deemed sacred is being traversed
by hosts of forbidding aspect
under the banners of natural science, of philosophy,
and of the psychology and history of religion.
The greatest foe of all, it has been
thought by some, has arisen within the household
of faith in the form of Biblical Criticism.</p>

<p>An eloquent American preacher, Dr. Richard
S. Storrs, has said that when Luther translated
the Bible into the vernacular, "the peasant's roof
was lifted to a level with the stars." Into every
home whose inmates could read there came,
with the Bible in their own tongue, the message
of divine love and redemption. With the freedom
to read the Bible came also the freedom to
study the Bible, to judge by its standard the doctrines
and usages of the church, to compare
Scripture with Scripture, and even to bring
Scripture itself with its credentials before the bar
of reason. Whatever the extremes into which
criticism may have run in an age in which the
Cartesian principle of doubt is applied to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
received opinion, the rights of Biblical Criticism
must be conceded as a legacy of the Reformation.</p>

<p>About the works of Homer, of Plato, of Dante
and of Shakespeare there has gathered a mass
of material in the way of commentary and discussion,
but it is safe to say that in recent years
the literary output in all of these departments of
study taken together is small in comparison with
that which centres around the Bible. The Biblical
critic has helped to attract to the Bible the
intellectual interest of our age, as well as to make
it the storm-centre of theological controversy.
He has made it a principal object of scholarly as
well as devotional interest, has thrown a flood of
light upon its pages from history, archæology,
philology and comparative religion, and has
challenged the devout Bible reader to a more
intelligent, minute and painstaking examination
of the fundamental documents of his faith.</p>

<p>The specialization of the age has assigned the
Old Testament and the New Testament to different
departments of study, and the problems of
each must be independently investigated. It is
evident, though, that the fortunes of the Old
Testament and the New are closely bound up
together. The same principles of criticism are
likely to be applied to both, and whether we begin
with naturalism or supernaturalism in the
Old Testament we shall probably end with it in
the New Testament. In both Testaments Babylonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
influence may be traced, and the twelve
apostles may follow the twelve patriarchs into
the limbo of myth. If no supernatural process
of redemption, in the way of history, prophecy
or revelation, can be discovered in the Old Testament,
it is unlikely that any will be discovered
at all. The Fourth Gospel as well as the Pentateuch
has been analyzed into documents, and
the same great historical transposition is seen in
both Testaments; Jewish monotheism is said to
have begun with Amos instead of with Abraham,
and Christianity in its distinctive features with
Paul instead of with Jesus.</p>

<p>The present state of discussion in the Old
Testament field indicates, to one not a specialist
in this department, that positions which have
been regarded as assured are not yet settled beyond
question. The literary analysis is ingenious
and plausible, but, as is shown in Orr's
"Problem of the Old Testament," the argument
is balanced. To offset the literary analysis and
the rearrangement of the history in accordance
with an evolutionary scheme, there are certain
considerations from history, archæology, and
common reason. No such analysis has been
ventured in the case of modern documents that
are confessedly composite, and in the case of
Homer, the nearest classical parallel, there is the
same uncertainty in the results.</p>

<p>Purely literary considerations, as Ramsay has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
remarked, yield before other more objective and
historical data, and the literary theories are adjusted
to meet the new situation.<a name="FNanchor_1_259" id="FNanchor_1_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The temporary
popularity in the New Testament field of the
Baur-Tübingen theories, based on Hegelian principles
of development, and then their general
abandonment, suggest the need of caution before
we accept any concensus of criticism, based upon
literary and philosophical grounds alone, as the
last word upon the subject. Our special concern
in this lecture is with the problems of the
New Testament, and we may consider briefly,
I. The Pauline Epistles, II. The Acts, III. The
Synoptic Problem, and IV. The Johannine
Problem.</p>

<br>
<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Pauline Epistles</span></p>

<p>It is frequently said that the figure of the
Apostle Paul stands out against the background
of history in bolder relief and with individual
features more strongly marked than does any
other character in antiquity. Not only has his
public career been narrated by one who was apparently
his friend and companion in labours,
but he has left a large collection of letters, full of
profound teaching upon religion and ethics, and
abounding in autobiographic details and in intimate
revelations of character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The school of Baur recognized as genuine only
the four central epistles, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians
and Galatians, making in bulk about
three-fifths of the writings, exclusive of Hebrews,
which have been assigned to Paul. The tendency
of criticism since the time of Baur has
been steadily in the direction of the acceptance
of other epistles as Pauline. Colossians, Philippians
and I Thessalonians have now been added
to the list of the generally accepted writings, and
it is only the fringe of Paul's writings that can
be said to be still in dispute. Of these "anti-legomena,"
2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and the
Pastorals, it is noticeable that two of them are
rejected largely on the ground that they resemble
so closely in ideas and vocabulary the admittedly
Pauline letters of I Thessalonians and Colossians,
while a Pauline nucleus is often acknowledged
in the Pastorals by those who do not assign the
epistles as a whole to Paul.</p>

<p>Students of Ephesians, moreover, are coming
to hear in it more and more clearly, if we mistake
not, the voice of the Apostle and the expression
of his mature Christian experience, and of that
doctrine of the church in which Royce sees the
essence of Paulinism. A. C. Headlam says that
it is the careful study of a book that will often
solve the question of its origin, and remarks:
"To me Ephesians is Pauline through and
through, and more even than Romans represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the deepest thought of the Apostle."<a name="FNanchor_2_260" id="FNanchor_2_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The important
fact is that, when all the disputed epistles
are excluded, the progress of criticism has placed
beyond reasonable doubt the great body of the
Apostle's teaching and the bulk of his writings.
The practical question now at issue, as Ramsay
has observed, is not, "What did Paul write?"
but "What did Paul teach?"<a name="FNanchor_3_261" id="FNanchor_3_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In Paul's acknowledged writings we have a
solid basis in fact from which to estimate the
Gospel narratives and the Acts. The epistles of
Paul carry us back into the circle of the earlier
apostles and of the Jerusalem church, and throw
light upon various events and aspects of the
life, character, words, death, and resurrection of
Christ.</p>

<br>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Acts of the Apostles</span></p>

<p>The book of Acts, while secondary in interest
to the Gospels, occupies a central place in New
Testament criticism. It is the bridge between
the Ascension and the time thirty years later
when Nero persecuted "a great multitude called
Christians at Rome." It covers the period in
which doctrinal evolution took place. Through
its authorship it bridges the gap between the Gospels
and the Pauline church among the Gentiles.</p>

<p>The course of the history in the early chapters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of Acts is so different from that which the imagination
of a later age would have pictured, that
it bears upon its face the marks of early origin
and of trustworthiness. To a later writer, without
contact with the actors, and writing after the
destruction of the Temple and the final breach
of the Christians with the Jews and the assured
success of the Gentile mission, it would seem
exceedingly improbable (1) that the apostolic
company should have continued to worship in
the Temple; (2) that they should at first have
found favour with the people; and (3) that they
should have remained in Jerusalem with no apparent
intention of leaving until scattered by
persecution; and perhaps (4) that the Sadducees
should have been the first to start the persecution.
The recorded history, improbable to a
later age, bears upon its face the stamp of truth.
The imagination of a post-Pauline writer would
have given us, we may be sure, a very different
picture of church history. It would scarcely have
conceived of the primitive Christology of Peter's
speeches, the use of the term, "child," or "servant"
of God (παῖς [pais]) in place of the Pauline term,
"Son of God" (υἱός [huios]), yet with the same attitude,
shared by Christians of earlier and later time, of
adoration, worship and love.</p>

<p>The presumption in favour of credibility is
strengthened by the author's full and detailed
treatment of persons and places. "A man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
would venture to introduce ninety-five persons
and a hundred and three places into a history of
his own times must have been pretty sure of his
ground. The majority of these persons were
still living when he wrote; into every one of
these places his volume shortly penetrated....
The correctness of his geography upholds the
truth of his history."<a name="FNanchor_4_262" id="FNanchor_4_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>A great many of the statements of the Acts
can be checked by comparison with Paul's
epistles, as has been shown by Paley's "Horæ
Paulinæ," and more recently, for the first part of
the Acts, by Harnack. In case of apparent conflict,
it has been said, "we are confronted by the
task of reconciling the differences between two
first-century documents, each of which has, admittedly,
very powerful claims."<a name="FNanchor_5_263" id="FNanchor_5_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> More than
half of the Acts is taken up with the labours
of the Apostle Paul, and yet the Acts does
not mention or show knowledge of his epistles.
This fact, used by some to throw doubt upon
the genuineness of the epistles, may be an indication
of the early date of the Acts, and of so
close a relationship between the author and the
Apostle that the evidence of letters would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Important alike in its bearing upon the questions
of credibility and authorship, is the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the so-called "we-sections." A <i>prima facie</i>
case is made out that the author of the Acts was
an eye-witness of some of the scenes it records,
and a companion in travel of the Apostle Paul.
This evidence has of late been greatly strengthened
by linguistic investigation. While critical
attempts are still made to divide the Acts into
documents, the "we-sections" (xvi. 10-17; xx.
5-15; xxi. 1-18; xxvii. 1-xxviii. 16), as Sir J. Hawkins
says, show an "immense balance of internal
and linguistic evidence in favour of the view that
the original writer of these sections was the same
person as the main author of the Acts and of the
Third Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_6_264" id="FNanchor_6_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>No living writers have done more to stimulate
interest in the book of Acts than have Sir W. M.
Ramsay and Harnack, and the writings of both
have materially strengthened the case alike for
its Lukan authorship, and, in the main, for its
historical accuracy. Ramsay, starting, as he says,
from the standpoint of the Tübingen school, "with
the confident assumption that the book was fabricated
in the middle of the second century, and
studying it to see what light it could throw on
the state of society in Asia Minor, was gradually
driven to the conclusion that it must have been
written in the first century and with admirable
knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_7_265" id="FNanchor_7_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>

<p>Harnack's defense, in his four monographs,<a name="FNanchor_8_266" id="FNanchor_8_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
of the Lukan authorship, integrity, historical reliability
(where the supernatural is not in question)
and early date of the Acts is the most outstanding
and significant achievement of the age
in New Testament criticism. Harnack's work
has been so thorough and convincing that it may
be said to have carried the theological world by
storm. At least his powerful argument for Lukan
authorship does not appear to have been successfully
met. The attempt to turn its flank by asserting
that the Paul of Acts, in making a vow,
shaving his head and entering into the Temple,
was not the defender of Gentile liberty who wrote
Galatians, and so that the author of the Acts was
not the companion of Paul, is met by Harnack in
the fourth of his monographs. Paul, he declares,
not only was a Jew, but remained so, whether
consistently or not. Harnack thinks that Paul
shrank back from taking the last logical step,<a name="FNanchor_9_267" id="FNanchor_9_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
but that in this the author of the Acts represents
the relation of Paul to Judaism precisely as do
his letters.<a name="FNanchor_10_268" id="FNanchor_10_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Stanton well remarks that the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of accounting for alleged discrepancies between
the Acts and the Epistles is equal or greater
on the supposition that the author wrote 100 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>,
or later, than if the author was the companion of
Paul.<a name="FNanchor_11_269" id="FNanchor_11_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The very fact, for example, that Luke
says that Paul worshipped in the Temple is an
indication that we have here no conception of a
later age to which such an act would have seemed
unnatural.</p>

<p>In his "Date of the Acts and of the Synoptic
Gospels" (IV), Harnack reverses his former opinion
and strongly defends a date for the Acts within
the lifetime of Paul and before the end of his trial
at Rome. Reviewing his former arguments for
a later date, he finds them inconclusive, and thinks
that the earlier date is required by the abrupt
close of the Acts. Minor considerations favouring
an early date are (1) the titles for Christ in
the early chapters, and for Christians, and the
description of the Jews as "the people of God";
(2) the fact that the Jews are the persecutors and
not the persecuted; (3) the absence of any indication
of the use of Paul's letters such as would
be expected in a later writer; (4) the use of the
"first day of the week," instead of the "Lord's
Day," and of the names of Jewish feasts, in which
Luke stands with Paul against later writers. And
(5) even the prediction, Acts xx. 25, which looks
primarily to Jerusalem, not Rome, would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
been written, if the second imprisonment be accepted,
after its apparent falsification by I Timothy
i. 3 and 2 Timothy i. 18. H. Koch develops
these arguments independently,<a name="FNanchor_12_270" id="FNanchor_12_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and it
can no longer be said that the early dating of the
Acts is "a pre-critical theory which rests on sentimental
or subjective grounds."<a name="FNanchor_13_271" id="FNanchor_13_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Why should the author follow so carefully the
fortunes of the Apostle on his voyage to Rome,
and describe so fully the initial stages of his trial,
and yet leave the reader in doubt concerning its
outcome? Commentators have been puzzled by
the seemingly inordinate space which Luke devotes
to the details of the voyage and shipwreck.
Sometimes it is said that the voyage marks the
final rejection of the Jewish people; or in the
description is seen a literary device intended to
intensify the suspense of the reader; or allegorical
interpretations are resorted to by those who
think that Luke would not thus descend from the
level of the philosophical historian to that of the
novelist.</p>

<p>In the minute description of the voyage and
shipwreck, Koch sees evidence that the writer's
experiences as Paul's companion on the voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were still fresh in his mind. The details would
scarcely have been remembered and recorded so
vividly after twenty-five years. Even if a journal
had been kept, it is still strange that the minutiæ
of the story should have been retained in the perspective
of the finished history. "The author
still stands under the fresh impression of the wonderful
divine guidance through which Paul, in
spite of all dangers and hindrances, reached his
long sought goal." "What interest would a
reader of later times have in details such as that
on an Alexandrian ship precisely two hundred
and seventy-six men were found?" In the seventh
or eighth decade more important contemporary
events would have stood in the foreground of interest.<a name="FNanchor_14_272" id="FNanchor_14_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
A striking parallelism has been observed
between the Third Gospel and the Acts,
while, supposing Paul's death to have occurred,
it is urged that Luke has missed "the finest&mdash;the
most essential&mdash;point of the whole comparison,
the death of Paul."<a name="FNanchor_15_273" id="FNanchor_15_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The assumed intention of the author to write a
third treatise does not help the matter much. It
is absurd, Ramsay admits, to relate the earlier
stages of the trial at great length, "and wholly
omit the final result which gives them intelligibility
and purpose"; but his conclusion is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
"it therefore follows that a sequel was contemplated
by the author," a sequel which the "first"
(prôtos) of Acts i. 1 implies, if Luke "wrote as
correct Greek as Paul wrote."<a name="FNanchor_16_274" id="FNanchor_16_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> But the intention
of writing a sequel does not explain the failure
to mention the outcome of the trial. Luke
would have no motive like the writer of a continued
story for keeping the reader in suspense,
and the simple addition of the words "until his
release or acquittal" would have relieved the
suspense, and given "intelligibility and purpose"
to the detailed description of the earlier stages of
the trial. The account of the Ascension is not
omitted from Luke's Gospel although given in
greater detail in the Acts. There is nothing un-philosophical
in the abrupt ending of a history
which brings the record down to the date of
writing.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>


<p>The leading argument against an early date
for the Acts is drawn from the possible use by
Luke of the writings of Josephus, and the crux
of the question is in the words put into the
mouth of Gamaliel (Acts v. 36, 37). The coincidence
of the names of Theudas and Judas of
Galilee (Acts v. 36, 37; Antiq. xx. v. 1 and 2) is
striking and, if the two men named Theudas be</p>

<p>(1) Luke had from Paul, whether or not Paul
was present at the meeting of the Sanhedrin, the
best means of knowing what Gamaliel, his teacher
and the spokesman of the Pharisaic party, actually
said. (2) The assumption that Luke was
quoting Josephus is in itself very difficult when
we compare the passages. Luke speaks of about
four hundred under Theudas while Josephus
mentions a great part of the people; Luke speaks
of Judas while Josephus speaks of the sons of
Judas. To quote thus loosely from his assumed
authority and then to commit the further blunder
of making Gamaliel allude to an event which occurred
at least a dozen years later is, while possible,
strangely out of keeping with Luke's proved
care and accuracy in most of his historical allusions.
The difficulty is acknowledged by those
who make Luke dependent on Josephus. Why
did Luke diverge from a correct narrative if he
had one before him? Writers who affirm (Holtzmann)
and those who deny (Schürer) the dependence
on Josephus practically agree that if Luke
had read Josephus he had forgotten him. (3) In
the narrative of the death of Herod (Acts xii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
20 f.; Antiq. xix. viii. 2), where the two authors
most obviously come together, both are plainly
describing the same event, and yet seem to be
quite independent both in the use of words and
in the details of the description. (4) The cumulative
evidence of an early date for Luke weighs
heavily in the scale against the hypothesis of
dependence upon the "Antiquities" written
about 93 or 94 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span></p>

<p>The question of date cannot be said to be absolutely
settled, but the tendency of criticism as
illustrated by Harnack is to the acceptance of an
early date, as well as to that of the Lukan authorship
of the entire book. It is difficult to
see how Harnack, with his present defense of a
date before Paul's release from prison, can consistently
maintain his skepticism where the supernatural
events recorded in the Acts are concerned.
It is idle to say that his "revolution in
chronology" has no effect upon the question of reliability.
It is an established principle of historical
method that the nearer a tradition is to the event
it professes to describe, the more likely it is to be
trustworthy. The resources of Harnack's learning
have been used in support of the reliability
of Luke in his geographical and chronological
references,<a name="FNanchor_17_275" id="FNanchor_17_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and his treatment of persons and
reports of their speeches.<a name="FNanchor_18_276" id="FNanchor_18_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> He has shown that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Luke was in touch with the leaders of the Jerusalem
church, and that his statements are abundantly
confirmed by the writings of Paul. If
Luke wrote within the lifetime of Paul, the Acts
was published while the main actors were still
living, and, by inference, it recorded events as
Peter and Barnabas and Apollos and Philip and
Mark thought that they happened. If further,
as Harnack argues, it was written during Paul's
imprisonment there seems no room for doubt
that it was written under the eye and with the
full endorsement of its principal actor, and that
we have thus the implicit guarantee not only of
Luke but of Paul also for the accuracy of its
record.</p>

<br>
<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Synoptic Problem</span></p>

<p>It has been said that the two most important
questions for religion are those of the rational
foundations of theism and of the trustworthiness
of the Four Gospels.<a name="FNanchor_19_277" id="FNanchor_19_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The Gospel records have
always been regarded as the citadel of the Christian
Faith. Not only do they contain the record
of works of power and words of grace, and of a
transcendent Personality, but they have always
been considered to have been themselves supernatural
in origin and character. They have been
regarded as "a house not made with hands"
(Robertson Nicoll), "a miracle of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Ghost" (Stier), "the heaven-drawn picture of
Christ, the living Word." The criticism of the
past century, in its quest for the historical Jesus,
has taken a very different attitude towards the
Evangelical records. By many critics they have
been regarded as a patchwork of traditions, a
work of pious but credulous men, whose idealization
and exaggeration, in the supposed interest
of faith, it is necessary to discount in order to
reach the bed-rock of historical fact.</p>

<p>The literary relation of the Synoptic Gospels
to one another has furnished to the New Testament
student a problem of great intricacy and
singular fascination. Its importance for our
present purpose is in its bearing upon the trustworthiness
of our canonical Gospels. The school
of Baur, under the influence of the Hegelian dialectic,
saw in Matthew, the Jewish Gospel, the
thesis; in Luke, the Gentile Gospel, the antithesis;
and lastly in Mark, the neutral Gospel,
the synthesis or last term of the development.
Criticism since the time of Baur has, with much
unanimity, seen in Mark not the latest but the
first of the Gospels, and has made Matthew and
Luke dependent upon Mark.</p>

<p>The theory which has for some years held the
field is the so-called "two-document" theory.
According to this Matthew and Luke, usually
regarded as independent of each other, are both
dependent, for much of their narrative portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and for the framework of their history, upon
Mark, and, for the non-Markan discourse material
which they have in common, upon a collection
of the sayings of Jesus, formerly designated
as "the Logia" but now usually called by the
letter "Q." The importance of the Synoptic
Problem, for our present purpose, is in its
historical rather than its literary features. Assuming
the priority of Mark, and assuming that
Matthew and Luke were dependent upon him
alone in those parts of their narratives which
have Markan parallels, it is clear that we must
regard all deviations made by the other Synoptists
from the Markan narrative as of only secondary
value. Variations from Mark, if Mark be the
sole source, whether these consist of additions,
omissions or modifications in the narrative, obviously
add nothing to our knowledge of the
facts, but simply represent changes which the
later writers have made in their source from subjective
reasons. It is important, then, to ask
whether, in the present state of opinion upon the
inter-Synoptic relations, there is reason to believe
that Matthew and Luke are following Mark as
their sole authority for the narratives which have
Markan parallels.</p>

<p>There is now a quite general recognition of
the fact that the literary problem presented by
the Synoptic Gospels is exceedingly intricate,
and that the "two-document" hypothesis in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
simplicity has not solved all the difficulties. It
is recognized that it must be modified in one of
three directions.</p>

<p>(1) There may be said to be a growing appreciation
of the part which oral transmission has
played in the composition of the Gospels. This
is shown for example in the volume of Oxford
"Studies in the Synoptic Problem" (1911),<a name="FNanchor_20_278" id="FNanchor_20_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and
by the statement of Sir John Hawkins, who, in
the second edition of his "Horæ Synopticæ"
(1909), expresses the strong opinion "that at
least the Second and Third Evangelists had
provided themselves with written documents as
their main sources, but that they often omitted to
refer closely to them, partly because of the
physical difficulties which there must have been
in consulting manuscripts, and partly because of
the oral knowledge of the life and sayings of
Jesus Christ which they had previously acquired
as learners and used as teachers, and upon which
therefore it would be natural for them to fall back
very frequently."<a name="FNanchor_21_279" id="FNanchor_21_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> It is natural to suppose,
with Schmiedel, that oral tradition continued for
a considerable time after the first documents
were written.<a name="FNanchor_22_280" id="FNanchor_22_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>

<p>(2) A considerable number of scholars, finding
that Mark condenses his account of such
incidents as the Baptism and Temptation of
Jesus and the discourse concerning Beelzebub,
and that Matthew and Luke are parallel in matter
which they add at these points to the Markan
account, have concluded that Mark must have
used Q, the assumed source of the Matthew-Luke
agreements. A moderate statement is that of
Dr. Sanday: "I do not think that Q was used
by Mark regularly and systematically, as the
later Evangelists use his own narrative; but he
must have known of its existence, and reminiscences
of it seem to have clung to him and from
time to time made their way into his text." <a name="FNanchor_23_281" id="FNanchor_23_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>(3) Another group of scholars, basing their
view on the agreement of Matthew and Luke
against Mark in matter with Markan parallels,
and on the difficulty of accounting for some
omissions from Mark in the later Evangelists
(such as the omission in Luke, where it would be
most appropriate, of the story about the Syro-Ph&#339;nician
woman), have framed a theory of
different recensions in Mark, one being used by
Matthew, a different one by Luke, and a final
recension, whether the work of the Evangelist
himself or of an editor, representing our canonical
Mark. This theory in different forms has been
advocated by Stanton in his "Gospels as Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Documents," Part II (1909), and more
recently by Holdsworth in his "Gospel Origins"
(1913). When the two-document theory is held
in this form, the priority of Mark belongs only
to the assumed earlier editions, for whose extent
and contents there is no objective evidence except
the assumed dependence, while our canonical
Mark is later than either Matthew or Luke.</p>

<p>There is a growing tendency to find secondary
elements in Mark as well as in Matthew or Luke.
Hawkins, it will be recalled, gives a list of passages
in Mark "which may have been omitted
or altered (by the other Evangelists) as being
liable to be misunderstood, or to give offense, or
to suggest difficulties."<a name="FNanchor_24_282" id="FNanchor_24_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Of the passages which
seem (a) to limit the power of Jesus, or (b) to be
otherwise derogatory to, or unworthy of Him,
the more noteworthy of the twenty-two instances
given by Hawkins are as follows: under (a),</p>

<p>1. Mark i. 32-34, "He healed many that were
sick." Matthew viii. 16, "He healed all"; cf.
Luke iv. 40, "Every one of them."</p>

<p>3. Mark vi. 5, "He could there do no mighty
work, save etc." Matthew xiii. 58, "He did not
many mighty works there because of their unbelief."</p>

<p>Under (b),</p>

<p>2. Mark i. 12, "The Spirit driveth him forth."
Matthew and Luke use words meaning to "lead."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Mark iii. 21, "They said he is beside himself."
This is omitted by Matthew and Luke.</p>

<p>10. Mark x. 17, 18, "Good Master" and
"Why callest thou me good?" appear in Matthew
xix. 16, 17 (R. V.) as "Master" and "Why
askest thou me concerning that which is good?"
Luke follows Mark.</p>

<p>Over against these passages may be placed
others where the change, if any, and whether
made unconsciously or for reasons of style or
with conscious tendency, would seem to be in
the other direction.</p>

<p>1. In the Parable of the Vineyard, Matthew
xxi. 37, "My son." Luke xx. 13, "My beloved
son." Mark xii. 6, "He had yet one, a beloved
son."</p>

<p>2. Matthew x. 42, "A cup of cold water only
in the name of a disciple." Compare Mark
ix. 41, "In name because ye are of Christ."</p>

<p>3. Luke xxiii. 47, "Certainly this was a righteous
man." Mark xv. 39, "Truly this man was
the Son of God," or "a son of God." Matthew
xxvii. 54 follows Mark.</p>

<p>4. (According to Bousset) Mark's abbreviation
of Q in iii. 27 makes it appear that it was
Jesus who bound the strong man, instead of
God.<a name="FNanchor_25_283" id="FNanchor_25_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>5. Matthew xiii. 55, "Is not this the carpenter's
son?" Compare Luke iv. 22, "Is not
this Joseph's son?" Mark vi. 3, "Is not this the
carpenter, the son of Mary?" Belief in the
Virgin Birth is perhaps safeguarded by Mark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Mark x. 45, "The Son of man came not
to be ministered unto, etc." Here Bousset sees
a dogmatic working over of Luke xxii. 27, "I
am among you as one that serves."<a name="FNanchor_26_284" id="FNanchor_26_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Matthew
xx. 28 follows Mark.</p>

<p>So far as tendency to Christological heightening
is concerned, critics of the school of Bousset
are now especially severe against Mark. It appears
that "Luke's Gospel in the Passion history
has preserved a series of primary traditions
over against Mark."<a name="FNanchor_27_285" id="FNanchor_27_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Holdsworth finds a
number of secondary elements, mostly stylistic,
in Mark where the three Gospels have a common
narrative. Among these are the vivid
touches of the second Gospel, considered to be
"distinctly secondary features," the fuller descriptions
in many instances, and the use of the
noun "gospel" not found at all in Luke although
the verb is used, and not found in Matthew in
its absolute sense.<a name="FNanchor_28_286" id="FNanchor_28_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Taking, then, the present state of opinion as
to the relation of our Mark to the other Gospels,
we see that while in general the "priority of
Mark" is in some sense defended, yet the relation
between any given passage in Matthew or
Luke and its parallel in Mark may be variously
construed. When Matthew, for example, deviates
from Mark, this modification according to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>
current theories may arise (1) from the first Evangelist's
fancy or his dogmatic tendency, and will
in either case be historically worthless. It may
arise (2) from reliable oral tradition, and in this
case be as worthy of credence as the Markan
source. It may be derived (3) from the source
Q, but may be for some reason omitted by Mark,
whose knowledge of Q is assumed. The deviation
in Matthew may (4) have been found in a
proto-or deutero-Mark, but have been omitted
in his final edition. The difference in this case
between Matthew and Mark is no greater than
that between two editions of the same work.</p>

<p>The point to be emphasized is that, in the
present state of opinion upon the Synoptic
problem, the difference of one Evangelist from
another does not in itself invalidate the testimony
of either. The Synoptic problem, while primarily
a literary problem, is indeed "fraught with momentous
issues which the Church, and not scientific
criticism only, is concerned to face";<a name="FNanchor_29_287" id="FNanchor_29_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but
in the present state of the discussion, the fact
that Matthew adds to or modifies the narrative
of Mark does not necessarily place the Matthean
modification upon a lower plane of credibility
than the Markan statement. The Matthean
modification may be an exact copy of an
earlier edition of Mark, or may be derived
from one of Mark's sources, Q, or may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
taken from that stream of oral tradition coming
from "eye-witnesses and ministers of the
word," which Luke in his preface evidently regarded
as the touchstone of historical truth,
whatever his use of written sources.</p>

<p>Passing over the vexed question of Q, we may
observe that the acceptance of Harnack's early
dating of the Acts and Luke would further complicate
the two-document theory. He agrees
that Luke was written before the Acts, and the
Acts before Paul's trial at Rome was decided;
further that Mark is one of the sources of Luke,
and that Mark was written at Rome. "Tradition
asserts no veto against the hypothesis
that Luke, when he met Mark in the company
of Paul the prisoner, was permitted by him to
peruse a written record of the Gospel history
which was essentially identical with the Gospel of
Mark given to the Church at a later time." Perhaps,
he intimates, "Luke was not yet acquainted
with Mark's final revision, which, as we can quite
well imagine, Mark undertook while in Rome."<a name="FNanchor_30_288" id="FNanchor_30_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
The priority of Mark, under this supposition, is
left hanging by a slender thread. It is highly
probable that Luke gathered the material for his
work (and a great part of it was certainly independent
of Mark) while in Palestine, and if he
did not see Mark's Gospel, or a rough draft of it,
until he was in Rome, it is improbable that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Markan document was his primary and principal
source, as the two-document theory asserts.</p>

<p>Whatever the literary foundation of the two-document
theory, it cannot be said to have led to
any very important historical results. Those
who regard the portrait of Jesus in Mark as historical
see in the portrayal of Matthew and Luke
only a difference in the <i>nuances</i> of the narrative.
On the other hand, those who cannot accept the
picture drawn by the First and the Third Evangelists
are equally unable to accept that given to
us by Mark. The criticism of the sources, in its
usual form, has not revealed to us a Jesus who is
more historical than the Jesus of any of the
Synoptists; and it is necessary to pursue the
quest in the more problematical region of
"sources of sources." In this process Mark is
found to be as little historical as the other Synoptic
Gospels, or even as the Gospel of John.</p>

<p>The "dissonances of the Evangelists" appear
to be left practically where they were before the
present movement in Synoptic criticism began.
They remain what they always have been when
one Gospel is compared with another, and are
neither softened nor made more acute by any
certain results which have been reached in the
study of the Synoptic problem. Some, no doubt,
may say that the discrepancies are so great that
the Synoptic Gospels cannot be accepted as historical
records; while others will say, as does a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
devout commentator on the Acts, that "such is
the naturalness of Holy Scripture that it seems as
though it were indifferent about a superficial consistency.
So it ever is with truth: its harmony
is often veiled and hidden; while falsehood sometimes
betrays itself, to a practised ear, by a
studied and ostentatious uniformity."<a name="FNanchor_31_289" id="FNanchor_31_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Others
again will appeal to the writers on historical
method, such as Langlois and Seignobos: "The
natural tendency is to think that the closer the
agreement is, the greater is its demonstrative
power; we ought, on the contrary, to adopt as a
rule the paradox that an agreement proves more
when it is confined to a small number of circumstances.
It is at such points of coincidence between
diverging statements that we are to look
for scientifically established historical facts."<a name="FNanchor_32_290" id="FNanchor_32_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
The inter-Synoptic differences are certainly, in
general, no greater than those which a single
author allowed himself in the accounts of the
same incident, as is shown in Luke's threefold
account of the conversion of the Apostle Paul.</p>
<br>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The Johannine Problem</span></p>

<p>It is scarcely surprising that the mystery which
surrounds the most mysterious Personality in
history should communicate itself to the records
which tell of His life, and even to the authors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
these records. If the Synoptic problem is a
"well," as Goethe said, the problem presented by
the "spiritual Gospel" usually assigned to the
Apostle John is equally fascinating and difficult.
The mystery of the Master has in part enveloped
the disciple whom Jesus loved.</p>

<p>The questions of the authorship and the historicity
of the Fourth Gospel are closely bound
together. If the Gospel is a theological romance
intended to give currency to the conceptions of
the Alexandrian philosophy, it is clear that its
authorship cannot be ascribed to one of the disciples
of Jesus. On the other hand, if it was
written by one of the Apostolic band, it must
certainly, whether reliable or not in its details,
contain a wealth of historical reminiscence which
will enrich our knowledge of the personality, the
words and the deeds of Christ.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that a strong defense
of the Apostolic authorship of the Gospel has
been made, in the present generation and in the
one which preceded it, by writers whose theological
position would incline them to an opposite
conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_33_291" id="FNanchor_33_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The strength of the evidence for
Johannine authorship lies in the testimony which
it receives from all parts of the early church,
whether divisions be made on geographical or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
theological lines, and in the links of connection
which bind the witnesses to the alleged scene of
John's labours and to the Apostle himself.</p>

<p>If it be objected that John, as a Galilean fisherman
and an unlettered man, could not have produced
a work so profound in thought and so
polished in Greek composition, the objection
may be compared with that which is raised
against the authorship of the plays which go
under the name of Shakespeare. Andrew Lang
remarks with irony upon the surprising belief
that "a young man from a little country town,
and later an actor, could possibly possess
Shakespeare's vast treasures of general information,
or Latin enough to have read the Roman
classics."<a name="FNanchor_34_292" id="FNanchor_34_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The external evidence for Johannine authorship
is strong and, with the exception of the
obscure sect of the "Alogi,"<a name="FNanchor_35_293" id="FNanchor_35_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> is uniform. It is
"sufficient," and there can be little doubt that
it would be efficient in producing general belief
except for the theological interests involved.
Objections to the Apostolic authorship from the
side of the external evidence are based (1) upon
supposed indications that John was martyred
with James at Jerusalem and never lived in
Ephesus at all, and (2) upon the statement of
Papias, interpreted to mean that two men by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
name of John lived in Ephesus. (1) The evidence
upon the first point is confessedly late and
confused. It is contained in the statements of
Georgios Hamartolos, a ninth-century writer,
and in the so-called "De Boor Fragment," purporting
to contain an extract from a fifth-century
writer, Philip of Side. The former says that
Nerva, "having recalled John from the island,
dismissed him to live in Ephesus. Then, being
the only survivor of the twelve disciples, and
having composed the Gospel according to him,
he has been deemed worthy of martyrdom. For
Papias, the Bishop of Hierapolis, having been an
eye-witness of him, says in the second book of
the 'Oracles of the Lord,' that he was slain by
the Jews, having, as is clear, with his brother
James, fulfilled the prediction of Christ concerning
him, and his own confession and assent in
regard to this." He adds that the learned
Origen, in his commentary on Matthew, "affirms
that John μεμαρτύρηκεν [memartyrêken] (has borne witness, or suffered
martyrdom), intimating that he had learned
this from the successors of the Apostles."<a name="FNanchor_36_294" id="FNanchor_36_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> But
Origen, in his comment on Matthew xx. 23, says
that "the king of the Romans, as tradition
teaches, condemned John, witnessing for the
truth, to the island of Patmos." If Georgios
Hamartolos thus incorrectly refers to Origen as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a witness to the martyrdom of John, less weight
attaches to his professed reproduction of the
statement of Papias.</p>

<p>The "De Boor Fragment" contains the statement
that "Papias, in the second book, says that
John the Divine and James his brother were
slain by the Jews."<a name="FNanchor_37_295" id="FNanchor_37_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> This supports the statement
of the ninth-century writer in regard to the
second book of Papias, but the evidence, whether
for the martyrdom of John by the Jews, or for
the fact that John was put to death at the same
time with his brother James, as is sometimes inferred,
is exceedingly slight. Paul (Gal. ii. 9)
speaks of John at a time usually identified with
the Council at Jerusalem (Acts xv.), although
Ramsay would identify it with Acts xi. 30, thus
placing it immediately before the death of James
(Acts xii. 2). The statement of Georgios that
John lived in Ephesus at the time of Nerva also
negatives this supposition. Of the slightly attested
view that John was martyred at an early
date, Dr. Dawson Walker remarks: "It is difficult
to think that this latter hypothesis would
have met with so great favour if it had not been
such an effective instrument in excluding St. John
from any possibility of being the writer of the
Fourth Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_38_296" id="FNanchor_38_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The statements that John was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
put to death by the Jews may possibly be an inference
from the prophecy, "The cup that I drink
ye shall drink, etc." (Mark x. 39).</p>

<p>(2) A mediating theory, based upon the well-known
statement of Papias<a name="FNanchor_39_297" id="FNanchor_39_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> in which a "presbyter"
John may, with much probability, be distinguished
from the Apostle of that name, does
not deny the influence of the Apostle upon the
construction of the Fourth Gospel, while its ultimate
authorship is assigned to the "presbyter"
John. The hypothesis of the two Johns rests
upon the statement of Papias' fragment as interpreted
by Eusebius; but Eusebius, while suggesting
that the "presbyter" might have written
the Apocalypse, indicates no doubt of the Apostolic
authorship of the Gospel and the First
Epistle. The possibility that there were two
Johns, who were both in some sense disciples of
the Lord (as Papias describes the "presbyter"),
who both lived in Asia Minor, and who were
both more or less concerned in the writing of the
Fourth Gospel, cannot be denied. But it is also
possible that Papias has been misinterpreted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
that, when he described the "presbyter" John,
the disciple of the Lord, he had only the Apostle
John in mind. In this case we should be freed
from the necessity, involved in the theory of authorship
we are considering, of supposing that
the Apostle had a mysterious <i>alter ego</i> of the
same name, who was with him alike in Palestine
and in Asia Minor, shared in a degree his authority
and published the substance of his teaching,
and so completely merged his personality in
that of the Apostle that in the Gospel record no
trace of a separate "presbyter" can be found,
and there is no mention of the name of either
John.</p>

<p>The First Epistle, supposed to be a sort of
supplement to the Gospel, is of importance in its
bearing upon the question of authorship. As a
recent writer says: "The persistent note of authority
which is overheard, rather than heard, in
the Epistles is the more impressive because it is
only implied. St. John assumes that his authority
is unquestioned and unquestionable by
those Asians who are loyal to the Christian
tradition. When we compare his letters with
those of his younger contemporaries, we conclude
that it was unquestionably because he was an
Apostle."<a name="FNanchor_40_298" id="FNanchor_40_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>

<p>Another mediating position, adopted by those
who do not accept the full Apostolic authorship,
is found in a theory of partition, which assigns
a portion of the Gospel to the Apostle. The
artistic unity of the Gospel and the qualities of
style which distinguish it from other writings
present a grave difficulty to any theory of partition.
As a sort of half-way house it will scarcely
be permanently tenable. Of Spitta's analysis,
which assigns a part of the Gospel to the Apostle,
it has been objected by a critic of more radical
sympathies that such an admission places him
outside the limits of scientific criticism.<a name="FNanchor_41_299" id="FNanchor_41_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The stronghold of the evidence alike for and
against the Johannine authorship is to be found
in the facts of the Gospel itself. On the one
hand a powerful argument, such as that which
has been developed by Lightfoot and Westcott,
can be drawn to show that the author of the
Gospel must have been a Jew, a Jew of Palestine,
a disciple of Jesus, one of the inner circle of disciples,
and in fact none other than the "beloved
disciple" himself. The internal facts of the Gospel
are used in a different way by others to show
that the Fourth Gospel differs so radically in scene,
in the style of its discourses, and indeed in its entire
portrait of Jesus, that it cannot be accepted as
historical, or as the work of one of the disciples.</p>

<p>The difference in scene between the Galilean<span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
Gospels and the Jerusalem Gospel presents no
great difficulty, but the crux of the problem is in
the difference in style and subject matter. The
Jesus of the Synoptics cannot, it is said, have
spoken in the style of the discourses in John.
Before this judgment can be accepted without
qualification, several points deserve to be noticed.
The difference in style is in part accounted for
by the difference in subject matter and in the
character of the audience. There are out-croppings
of the Johannine style in the Synoptics,
especially where the subject of discourse is similar.
The passage, Matthew xi. 25-30, which, as
we have seen, contains the essential teachings
found in John xiv., is a notable illustration. The
Jerusalem audience again was different from the
Galilean audience. If it be said that when the
Jesus of the Fourth Gospel speaks in Galilee
(John vi.) He uses the same mystical style as
when He speaks in Jerusalem, it should at least
be considered that the discourse in Capernaum
is not given as a sample of the usual synagogue
preaching of Jesus. The scene clearly marks a
crisis in the ministry, a crisis indicated in the
other Gospels by the northern journey for retirement
which immediately followed, but made more
intelligible by the supposition that the Capernaum
discourse was practically a clearer revelation
to the Galilean audience of the consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of Jesus and the spiritual character of His work.
When we recall that such expressions, familiar
to John, as <i>Logos</i>, Lamb of God, propitiation for
sin, are never placed by John in the mouth of
Jesus, we have strong negative evidence that the
discourses of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel are not
the free composition of the author himself.</p>

<p>After all, the question of the style of the Fourth
Gospel is not so important as that of its contents.
Does it draw an essentially different picture of
Jesus from that of the Synoptic writers, or does
it help us to fill out and to interpret the Synoptic
portrait? Two considerations of a general nature
should be kept in mind. Ordinary readers
of the Gospels in all ages have seen no lack of
unity in the composite portrait of the four Gospels;
and recent criticism has shown that even to
the sharp sighted modern critic the harmony is
so great that one who rejects the historical character
of John's Gospel will also reject the Second
Gospel, which was written from the standpoint
that Jesus is the Son of God (so Bousset), and is
to be distinguished from the Fourth Gospel in
degree (<i>graduel</i>) rather than in essence. The
aim of Mark, and there is no reason to doubt
that he reaches his aim, is in fact the same as
that of John, so far as concerns his desire that
his readers may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God (John xx. 31).</p>

<p>If what the Synoptic Gospels say is true as to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
the words and the works and the claims and the
consciousness of Jesus, then we should expect
some such supplement as we find in John. We
should expect either more or less than we find
in the Synoptic Gospels. When we read of the
Divine Voice at the baptism and the transfiguration,
we ask, What did Jesus Himself conceive
His relation to God to be? The full answer is
in John. When we read, "Where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I in
the midst of them" (Matt. xviii. 20), we should
expect fuller teaching on the relation of Jesus to
the disciples. This we have in the last discourses
in John. When we read in the Synoptists accounts
of the teaching and the mighty works, we
turn to John for the full description of the Teacher
and Lord, and of the mighty Worker manifesting
His glory. The Synoptic Gospels tell us
of the authority of Jesus and of His office of
judgment and of His founding a Church. In
John we see the ground of His authority in His
relation to God and in His mystical relation
to the disciples. In the Synoptists we have
the Last Supper and general prophecies of the
future and commands for the guidance of the
Church. We should expect some more intimate
and personal revelation of His relation to the
disciples, such as is furnished by the Johannine
picture of the disciple whom Jesus loved, and in
the words, "Woman, behold thy son" (John xix.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
26, 27); and in the intimate discourse of John
xiv.-xvi. When we read, once more, that Jesus
often retired for prayer, but in the Synoptic Gospels
have the record of only one or two of His
petitions: "Remove this cup from me....
Thy will be done" (see Luke xxii. 42 and compare
xxii. 32), we expect some such enrichment
of our knowledge of the prayer-life of Jesus as is
contained in John xvii.</p>

<p>The historical character of the Fourth Gospel
is shown alike by the light which it throws upon
the course of events in the public ministry and
by the more subtle resemblances between John
and the Synoptists, so different in emphasis and
shading that John's account cannot well have
been due to Synoptic tradition, and yet so much
in agreement as to give confidence that the same
course of events underlies both accounts. If we
look at the outward course of events under the
guidance of writers such as Askwith<a name="FNanchor_42_300" id="FNanchor_42_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> or A. E.
Brooks,<a name="FNanchor_43_301" id="FNanchor_43_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> we see that John's picture of the earliest<span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>
disciples in Judea may throw light upon the narrative
of the call of the four (Mark i. 16 f.). The
crisis in the ministry, indicated rather than explained
in the Markan narrative, is more intelligible
in the light of John vi. The hosannas
of the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, as well as
the settled determination of the rulers to put
Jesus to death, can be better understood with
the help of John's statements about Lazarus (see
John xii. 9-11); and the accusation of the witnesses,
"We heard him say I will destroy this
temple" (Mark xiv. 58), and the weeping of
Jesus over Jerusalem (Matt, xxiii. 37) are again
more intelligible in view of the Johannine statements
about the temple of His body (John ii.
20, 21), and the accounts of His frequent visits to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Relationships of a more subtle kind may be
found when John is compared with the Synoptic
Gospels. (1) The relation of Jesus to His mother
is the same in both. Compare Luke ii. 49,
"Knew ye not that I must be in the things of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>
my Father"; and John ii. 4, "Woman, what
have I to do with thee?" The relation with His
brethren is also the same, their right to influence
Him not being admitted. (2) The causes of
opposition are differently described, but are the
same in principle. In both Mark ii. and John v.,
the charges against Him are those of blasphemy
and Sabbath breaking, and in both cases are
made in connection with the miracle of healing.
His defense of His action in healing on the
Sabbath day is the same in principle but different
in detail. In both there is an <i>à fortiori</i> argument:
"How much then is a man of more value
than a sheep!" (Matt. xii. 12); "If a man receive
circumcision on the Sabbath ... are ye
wroth with me because I made a man every
whit whole on the Sabbath?" (John vii. 23). In
both cases His action is defended by reference to
His unique position, in the one case in His relation
to God, "My Father worketh hitherto"
(John v. 17); and in the other case in His relation
to men, "The Son of man is lord even of
the Sabbath" (Mark ii. 28). (3) The relation of
Jesus to various classes of people as described by
John is remarkably different in detail, but wonderfully
similar in essence, when compared with
the Synoptic record. In each with entire difference
of scene and circumstance He meets with a
woman that was a sinner, but the essentials of
penitence and the public expression of gratitude<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>
are similar in both (Luke vii. 37 f.; John iv. 7 f.).
No narratives could be more independent of each
other than those of the conversation with Nicodemus
in John iii., and with the rich young ruler
in Mark x., yet in both cases the attitude of Jesus
towards an influential and upright and religious
man was the same. In spite of difference in
language also, the words to Nicodemus, "Ye
must be born again" (John iii. 7), do not differ in
their radical demands from the words addressed
to the ruler, "One thing thou lackest: go, sell
whatsoever thou hast and come, follow me"
(Mark x. 21).</p>

<p>The comparison might be continued indefinitely,
but only to show that the picture of Jesus
and of His relation to the Father, and to His
disciples, to publicans and sinners, to the Pharisees,
to women, and to the human race as Saviour
and Judge, is so different in John that it cannot
be due merely to the influence of the Synoptic
tradition, and yet so identical in substance that it
cannot possibly, with any regard for literary
probabilities, have been the free invention of the
writer.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that the writer of the
Fourth Gospel took for granted in his readers an
acquaintance with the narrative or the tradition
of the Synoptic Gospels. He would not have
written unless he had some new light to throw
upon the figure of Jesus, or some deeper insight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
into His personality and work. The photograph
and the portrait may not perhaps agree in their
mechanical measurements, but to one who knows
the subject the portrait may reproduce the original
as faithfully, and even more adequately, than
does the photograph. Each is useful for its own
purpose, but both together are needed to give us
the body and the soul, the exact features and the
expression, the total impression of the personality.</p>

<p>The criticism of the Gospels has thrown the
figure of Jesus into strong relief, not only against
the background of His time, but against the
background of humanity in general. In its recent
developments, it has left us practically with
the choice between the Christ of the four Gospels
or a shadowy figure to be found in none of them.
The true historical Jesus that criticism has brought
before us is clad in the coarse garments of Galilee,
but with the glory of the only-begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

<p>The searchlight of modern knowledge is the
fierce light that beats upon the throne. As nature
and the human soul and the relationships of
thought and the phenomena of religion and the
book of revelation are more fully studied, the
majesty and beauty of the central Figure in history
is more clearly revealed. Each age sees a
new glory in Jesus Christ. "It is one of the
evidences of the moral greatness of Jesus," says
Peabody, "that each period in Christian history,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
each social or political change, has brought to
view some new aspect of His character and given
Him a new claim to reverence." The modern
age sees in Him and in His Cross of love and
sacrifice the guide and inspiration of its ethical
and social advance. It sees in Him and in His
Cross the solution, so far as ultimate solution
may be possible, of its deepest intellectual problems.
It sees in Him not merely a Guide and a
Revealer, but a Redeemer from sin and the Giver
of Eternal Life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Discloses the secret of Dr. Gordon's eloquence&mdash;fresh,
and intimate presentations of truth which always keep close
to reality. Dr. Gordon also seems to have the world's literature
at his command. A few of the titles will give an idea
of the scope of his preaching. 'The Law of Truth: The
Science of Universal Relationships'; 'The Law of Inspiration:
The Vitalizing Power of Truth'; 'The Law of Vibration';
'The Law of Beauty: The Spiritualizing Power of Thought';

<p>It is fitting that one who is noted for the grace, finish and

and the most dynamic utterances of America's greatest pulpit

<p>The Moral Paradoxes of St. Paul</p>

<p>12mo, cloth, net $1.00.</p>

<p>"These sermons are marked, even to greater degree than is usual with
their talented preacher, by clearness, force and illustrative aptness.
He penetrates unerringly to the heart of Paul's paradoxical settings
forth of great truths, and illumines them with pointed comment and
telling illustration. The sermons while thoroughly practical are garbed
in striking and eloquent sentences, terse, nervous,
attention-compelling."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>The Prodigal and Others</p>

<p>12mo, cloth, net $1.00.</p>

<p>"The discourses are vital, bright, interesting and helpful.
It makes a preacher feel like preaching once more on this
exhaustless parable, and will prove helpful to all young people&mdash;and
older ones, too. Dr. Broughton does not hesitate to
make his utterances striking and entertaining by the introduction
of numerous appropriate and homely stories and illustrations.
He reaches the heart."&mdash;<i>Review and Expositor.</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> If Paul taught not a bodily but a "spiritual" resurrection, as
some interpreters think that his language in I Cor. xv. 50 implies, the
emphasis upon the supernatural would be greater in the case of the
primitive church. In his "Historical Evidence for the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ," 1907, Kirsopp Lake says that the affirmation of
an empty tomb was made by most early Christians, and "almost
certainly by St. Paul" (p. 242). He contends, however, that the
"story of the empty tomb must be fought out on doctrinal, not on
historical or critical grounds" (p. 253).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Recent exegesis finds a Pauline meaning in the words whether
it refers them to Jesus or to the influence of Paul. Plummer ("Matthew,"
p. 280) says: "'The Son of Man came' implies the preëxistence
of the Son; it is not merely a synonym for being born."
(Cf. John xviii. 37.) In the use of the word λύτρον [lytron], Bacon thinks
that, "here and in xiv. 24 Mark goes beyond Paul's careful use of
language" ("Beginnings of Gospel Story," p. 149). Bousset, on
the other hand, emphasizing "the many," thinks that Paul was the
first to give the full reach to the thought. (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 2.)
According to Wendling, in Mark x. 45, the fully developed Pauline doctrine
of the ἀπολύτρωσις [apolytrôsis] (Rom. iii. 23 ff.) is crystallized into an
aphorism and put into the mouth of Jesus; "The Son of Man came not to be
ministered unto, etc." (See Sanday's "Oxford Studies," p. 399.)</p></div>

approach to any of these high faculties [such as are seen in man] or
show any indication of the possibility of their development. In very
many directions they have reached a limit of organic perfection beyond
which there is no apparent scope for further advancement.
Such perfect types we see in the dog, the horse, the cat-tribe, the
deer and the antelopes, the elephants, the beaver and the greater
apes; while many others have become extinct because they were so
highly specialized as to be incapable of adaptation to new conditions.
All these are probably about equal in their mental faculties, and there
is no indication that any of them are or have been progressing
towards man's elevation, or that such progression, either physically
or mentally, is possible."&mdash;"Man's Place in the Universe," 3d

Kennedy believes that the vocabulary of Paul is to be explained from the
Old Testament, while much of it was current among the mystery brotherhoods
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 198). Bousset acknowledges that Paul's terminology
may perhaps in part be derived from the Old Testament,
which would be the most natural source of his use of <i>pneuma</i> instead
of <i>nous</i> to describe the spiritual part of man, and of the opposition
in words between <i>pneuma</i> and <i>sarx</i> (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 141,
note 2). Clemen ("Der Einfluss der Mysterienreligionen auf das älteste
Christentums," 1913, p. 61) says that "looked at broadly, Paul remains in
verbal and much more in actual relationships untouched by the mystery
religions."</p></div>

what the Synoptists declare it to have been, namely, to prepare the
way for the Christ, it is hardly conceivable that this work, faithfully
carried out, could have failed of this result&mdash;to supply disciples for
Him" (p. 59).</p></div>

Biblical Essays." The best explanation of the silence of the Synoptists
upon the raising of Lazarus is still that given by Holdsworth, "Gospel
Origins," p. 126: "Every missionary knows that to mention the
names of converts in published accounts of their work among a
people hostile to Christianity is fraught with peril to those who are
mentioned.... The difficult question of the appearance in the
Fourth Gospel of the raising of Lazarus finds its best explanation in
an application of this rule.... Although the Synoptists record
the saying of Christ that the name of the woman who broke the bottle
of spikenard ... should be mentioned [or rather her deed]
wherever the Gospel was proclaimed, that name was never mentioned
by them." Long afterwards John mentions Mary's name.</p></div><br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
